# Facilitator Guide

Some key points to include:

In community buildings, we often find volunteers doing things that are beyond their physical abilities.  This is often because as they age, they don't want to admit that they are no longer so strong or steady on their feet.  It's also just part of the "can do" culture in service to the community - but they can be a danger to themselves, others, and the building itself.  Don't forget that your leadership of the group gives you a certain status - please strongly reinforce the "no ladders or worn steps" rule.  You can help reduce temptation by point the group towards safer alternatives, like estimating the unknown height of a space by counting stones. You can also remind the group that they don't need to gather ever detail about their building.  The professionals they engage later will be equipped to find out what they need at the time.

## What if I'm not an expert? 

Group members are very likely to assume you have expert knowledge about buildings.  Although as engineers you bring some special skills to the programme, we're only expecting numeracy, the ability to understand scientific concepts, and problem-solving skills - things that all engineers share.  One of the real skills in work like this is being comfortable saying you don't know the answer to something!  

We have a panel of programme advisers who expect to answer questions.  Some of the volunteer engineers work in building services and have said that they also are interested in providing peer support or helping us improve the programme.   

# What if this is my area - what about professional indemnity?

Even if you are a building services engineer, you are not providing a professional service as part of the programme.  We are stressing throughout the programme that this is an exercise that should point them in the right direction, but they need to take professional advice before acting on the results.
