# How to test a thermostat

Expect analogue thermostats to be accurate to plus or minus 2C (which really isn't very good, these kinds of swings are bad enough to affect thermal comfort) and digital ones to plus or minus 1C.

Things to test for:

- whether it registers a temperature that is representative of what users feels - especially useful if you're unsure whether it's mounted on something too cold (external stone walls always bad, other stone mountings it depends), what the airflow is like around it, solar gain, too near heat sources.
- whether it is wired correctly/whether the wiring is broken or whether this is really a thermostat for a previous heating system that no one bothered to remove (because they didn't want to redecorate)
- on a wireless model, whether the signal is reaching and the batteries are working.   If not, the system might default to on :TODO: check this, think I remember it for one, off, or use a temperature reading at the timeswitch, depending on the model.

(1) turn the thermostat and listen for a click when you get to the temperature the room is.  It just checks that the thermostat itself isn't too broken, really. 

(2) when the heating is on and the church is warm enough, turn the thermostat down slowly and see if/when the heating turns off.   You might need two people for this, or to go back and forth a lot, because you need to look either for (say) a flame icon on the timeswitch or at the front of the boiler (although the boiler can go off because the radiators are warm even if the room is still below the target temperature).  If the heating goes off before you reach the temperature the church is (more or less - analogue thermostats are only good to within 2C) maybe it matches the temperature in the vestry instead, suggesting a problem.

However, that looks like it's set to 21C - so in practice it's not doing anything, as neither of your spaces ever reaches anything like that temperature I think.  It's a useful safeguard in case the heating ever does come on for a long time accidentally, and would be an even better safeguard set a bit lower, but it's not limiting the heat going into the space at present.
