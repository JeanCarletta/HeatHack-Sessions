# How much heating does the building need?

There are two possible reasons to do this assessment.

One is for spaces that you aspire to use more.  For them, it can help answer the question, "how much energy should it take to make this space comfortable, and what would it cost?"  Only with this information is it possible to do the financial modelling to know whether hiring the space out would cover the costs required to do so. 

The second is for spaces that you can't get warm despite putting energy in. In "wet" systems, installers often offer to put in a bigger boiler, but the real problem could be that there aren't enough radiators shedding heat in the space.  Or it could be something else entirely. We can't change our systems overnight and some of them may be in use for some time, especially if we are able to use them in combination with lower carbon approaches.  Knowing whether it's a sizing problem or some more cheaply correctable fault with the system could be important for using less energy now.
