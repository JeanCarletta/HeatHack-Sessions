# Technical exercise: is there enough heating? 

If a community building with a wet system feels cold, it's easy (and profitable!) for installers to recommend putting in a bigger boiler.  Many boilers are over-sized for the spaces they heat "just in case" or making assumptions about hot water demand that are incorrect for community buildings, which makes them operate less efficiently. :TODO: REFERENCE.  Even when a change to the heating system is needed, supplying more heating often isn't the right solution.  Many community buildings don't have enough radiators or other sources of heat output.  

Heating consultants know how to estimate heating requirements to decide whether the problem is the boiler capacity, the radiators, or both.  In this exercise, you will be performing a simplified version of this assessment to get a picture of this for your building.  If you have electric radiators, the same approach an still be useful for knowing whether they are the size that would be expected for your space.

A word of warning first:  if you do find that there is insufficient capacity to make users comfortable either because of the boiler or because of the radiators, that doesn't mean you will want to change the boiler or add more radiators to your system.  These are relatively expensive fixes that lock you into the heating technology you have.  In particular, more modern, low carbon heat technologies like heat pumps are usually incompatible with existing radiators.  But it's still useful to understand your starting point.  

:TODO: Hmmm - not convinced how many places need this.  Just the ones that want to be in fuller use but are currently feeling cold, to find out if they're likely putting enough energy into the building/how much energy would need to go in (and therefore ballpark what it might cost, how much income they would need to get off the room hires to do that)
- need to describe why change is needed in grant proposal and insufficient capacity might be part of this
- for spaces that are cold, gives a ballpark for how much heat loss would need to be reduced before this system could cope?
- maybe it's really an inverted argument, if they're cold and it comes out as sufficient, they know it's the heat loss.
- useful for knowing how to combine (hopefully less!) use of your existing system with other approaches to making people comfortable in a "hybrid" strategy at least until you can make a complete transition
