# Estimating the cost of using a room

Many community buildings have never tried to estimate what costs they incur when their spaces are used, but this is a very important part of being financially viable, and also of setting prices for room hires. Even if the hirer deserves a charitable rate, the premises costs have to be met from somewhere.

:TODO: write correctly

Minimally,
- electricity and gas costs
- contribution to maintenance
- contribution to staffing costs

Lighting is pretty straightforward, number of lamps times wattage times length of use.
Electric heating also straightforward but the kW rating of heatings is usually on the side facing the wall!
Can sometimes use clamp on energy meters (like the utility companies were giving away circa 2010) to measure kW draw on a circuit.

Costs are much higher in the winter (even for lighting in many spaces) but except for dedicated worship spaces it's usual to use average costs over the year or just use estimates from, say, early December when the temperature typically is low but not at its absolute worst.

Something like 60W per heating pump.

Can be very difficult to construct an estimate for heating costs on wet systems, especially if there are multiple systems on the same meter (for instance, gas boilers for several spaces).  Some techniques:

- for lightly used buildings, if you can find a time when a space is heating from cold and other spaces aren't being used, timelapse photography using an old digital camera or smartphone is sometimes possible (hard if the meter is in a meter cupboard)

- taking all the room hires over a year, estimating the volume
