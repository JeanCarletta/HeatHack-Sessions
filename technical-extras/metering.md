# Reading a meter and estimating energy use

:TODO: write properly, some material is in blog post.

Energy monitoring absolute key to understanding consumption but most community buildings aren't set up to get meter readings and even just rely on estimated readings, with the treasurer only ever looking at the prices on the bills.  

- read energy meters https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumer/energy/energy-supply/your-energy-meter/how-to-read-your-energy-meter/ - be careful, gas meters can be in either ft3 or m3. Which yours is will be marked clearly on the facade.

Quickest way is smartphone photo that timestamps reading automatically; a smartphone app for entering readings; or a log book next to the meter (show what a logbook page would look like).

Recommend getting smart meters, then with Loop app should be able to get half-hourly meter readings even if their supplier doesn't give them direct access;  some suppliers do.

For more complex sites, it may be worth having submetering or energy monitoring installed in the supply cabinet.

For very simple lower powered sites, it may be worth using a clip-on meter.
