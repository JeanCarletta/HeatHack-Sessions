# Welcome

Welcome to the HeatHack programme for community buildings.  This guide provides some background  reading materials for the programme.  As well as a general introduction to explain what the programme is for and what it will be like, and providing some very important Health and Safety information, it explains the basic concepts introduced in the sessions.  

There is a separate guide for the group leaders - the main group contact and the volunteer engineer - to help them in running the sessions.

There is also a separate guide explaining how to use our thermal monitoring devices.


These reading materials are a work in progress.  We will add as we go along guided by what you tell us you need.  In July 2023 we will ensure all of the materials are openly available, including instructions for how to buy thermal monitoring equipment or build it cheaply from electronic components, so that anyone can use them.

This programme is dedicated to the Boston Womenâ€™s Health Collective.  Since the 1970s, they have been empowering women to collaborate in their own health care.  This is oddly similar to what we want to achieve!  It is also dedicated to volunteers everywhere helping to look after our community buildings.
