# Avoiding damp



Some community groups with buildings that are only lightly used turn on the heating for a little while every day because they're worried about a building being damp or because they're trying to dry out a building that is already damp.  This isn't the best way to approach the problem.  To understand
why not, we need to consider why buildings get damp in the first place.


- **Water ingress.**  If there's just one thing that's important to keep the building in good shape, it's making sure the roof is sound and that the rainwater clearance systems - gutters (called "rhones" in Scotland) and downpipes must be in good working order and kept clear.  With the increased rainfall that comes with climate change, some buildings are already finding that they have to increase the capacity of their rainwater clearance to avoid wetting the walls of their building.  Wet walls also make the inhabitants miserable because they lose heat much faster than dry ones.  

- **Blocked vents.**  People and sometimes other activities release moisture into the building.  If the building's vents are blocked, then it's hard for that moisture to escape.  Some building operators deliberately block vents to avoid heat escaping.  In many others, the walls have exterior air intake vents at ground level that get clogged with leaves and other debris.  Many older buildings have design features that are intended to be used to vent warm, moist air from the building after use. These might opening windows and rope pulls for opening the louvres on a tower.

In traditional buildings, also:

- **Non-breatheable finishes.** Require lime plaster and breatheable paints - and often the issue with mysterious damp problems.

- **Inappropriate or incorrectly installed insulation.** Again, breatheability of the materials but also the design (not allowing the required airflow to preserve the roof, for instance).

- **Warm moist air from outside.** It's tempting on a nice spring day to open the building up and let the air warm the building, but in a massive stone building, the surfaces can be cold enough to cause condensation to run down the walls inside the building.

 
 If your building is damp, dehumidifiers will dry it out more cheaply than turning the heating on, and you can focus them just on the damp area.


A building might not need heating, but it will definitely need careful attention to ventilation so that it stays dry.
