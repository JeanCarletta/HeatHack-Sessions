# For frost protection

Groups also sometimes turn the main heating on frm 1 to 3 a.m. to keep pipes as frost protection in cold weather.   If you don't have a better frost protection mechanism then you have to do something, but you'd be better off working out the right strategy for your premises.  

Pipe insulation for vulnerable pipes will help.  You can get small, low energy pipe heaters designed specifically for frost protection that would be more cost-effective than running the main heating.

Most boilers come with frost protection built in to protect the heating system.  If you are using a frost stat in the boiler room or the main space, a good arrangement is to bring the heating system pumps on at a temperature that you consider a relatively low risk.  Moving water doesn't freeze as easily as still water, and pumps take less energy to run than boilers.  Then you can bring the heating on at a temperature where the risk is greater.
