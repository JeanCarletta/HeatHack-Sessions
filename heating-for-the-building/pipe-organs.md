# Pipe organs

Churches often heat because they think the pipe organ needs it warm.  Pipe organs aren't bothered by cold.  They are bothered by temperature variations, especially if the temperature varies quickly.   That means heating systems that raise the air temperature quickly can be a problem for them.  They can sound out of tune unless they are tuned at the same temperature that they are played.  They also care very much about being too dry, and somewhat about being too damp.  55-75% RH is the ideal range.

When you have a new heating system installed, it's common for the installers to turn the heating on and leave it running uncontrolled 24/7 until they have an electrician available to wire in the controls.  We've seen more than one pipe organ ruined this way.

How you handle this takes careful thought, but this isn't necessarily a reason for running the heating more.
