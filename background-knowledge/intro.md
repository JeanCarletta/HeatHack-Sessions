# Practical reading

We aim to make our programme self-contained so anyone can take our materials and run successful groups, and practical so that groups find it easy to act on their decisions.  This section helps reinforce the programme concepts and provide practical support for some of the trickier actions like choosing good heating controls.

We are writing materials "on demand" in response to group questions as fast as we can and working to connect groups with external services.  Please tell us what you need.
