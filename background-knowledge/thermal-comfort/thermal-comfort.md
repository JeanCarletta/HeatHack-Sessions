# Heating for comfort

We heat buildings mostly for the people who use them. That means it's very important to understand what makes people feel comfortable.

Because we're used to controlling heating with thermostats, air temperature is the first thing most people think of, but how people feel depends on much more than the temperature of the air.

The other things that matter are:


- **Temperature of surrounding surfaces (mean radiant temperature).**  Weâ€™re all familiar with what heat radiating to us from the sun feels like.  When we're surrounded by surfaces that are cooler than our body temperature, something similar happens - heat radiates from us to the surfaces, making us feel cooler.  

- **Draughts.** Even a warm draught feels cold.  Women tend to feel draughts more keenly than men do.  

- **Relative humidity.** This is the amount of moisture the air has compared to the total amount of moisture it can hold, which varies with the temperature of the air.  The warmer the air is, the more moisture it can hold.  Relative humidity has a range from 0-100%.  When it reaches 100%, moisture falls out of the air.  The damper a building is, the colder it will feel.

- **How active the occupants are (metabolic rate).**  If people are running around, they will be comfortable at lower temperatures.  

- **Clothing levels.** Up to a point, more layers of clothing and materials like wool that trap air will also make people comfortable at a lower temperature.

```{admonition} Top Comfort Tip

One of the most important things you can do is ensure consistent, non-draughty conditions so your building's users know how much clothing to bring and don't have to keep changing it while they are in the venue.  People are very adaptable as long as they can predict what they need to do.  This makes it very important to get your heating controls right.  There are so many issues with thermostats in community venues that we offer specific advice about them.
