# Heated seating

Heated seating is more common in churches than in other community venues.  It could take the form of hot pipes or small radiators under or near the seats, or it could be heated seat cushions.  For cushions, there are a wide range that vary in price from the sort of small rechargeable ones popular in football stadiums to ones that are wired permanently into the mains.  There are some prominent churches in Central Europe where this is the only form of heating.

Even just having an unheated cushion or something more like carpet between a person and a cold surface will improve their comfort.

We have been told about cheap, plug-in radiant panels sold for people working from home.  In community buildings, it's better for devices to be permanently wired to the wall and to turn off automatically, for safety and to keep costs from escalating.
