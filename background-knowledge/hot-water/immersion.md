# Immersion heaters

Immersion heaters use an electrical heating coil in a tank of hot water for your supply.  Controlling their energy use is like dealing with a hot water cylinder, except that they often have an override or on/off switch that means users might leave them on permanently. 

Sometimes buildings have both an immersion and a tank supplied by a gas boiler that is mostly for heating.  Sometimes this is just in case the boiler breaks down, but depending on the boiler and the immersion, it can be more efficient to switch to the immersion in the summer when the heating is off.
