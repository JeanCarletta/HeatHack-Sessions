# Are the radiators and boiler big enough?

 Once you know your target temperature, someone should do a calculation that uses it to estimate how much heat it will take to warm the space, check the boiler puts out enough heat, and also check that the radiators and pipework deliver that heat.  There are reasonable on-line calculators they might work for modern buildings, but they vary in quality and they don't apply well to older or more ornate spaces.  If in any doubt, you should get an independent heating consultant to do a survey that checks this for you and tells you what you require.

The age of your system will give a hint about your radiators.  If they were put in after around 1990, they're probably generously sized already.  If they are from before then, or any radiators have been removed, they may not be.  Expectations about heating have risen over the years!  In an old church building with the original radiators, even if they were intended to heat the air, that was probably only for a temperature of 12-14C.

To check whether the size of the boiler or the radiators is  a problem takes calculating the heat loss from the space, the heat output of the boiler, and the heat output of the radiators and pipework.

Radiators are just metal and hot water at various temperature differences to the temperature of the air in the space.  You don't need data for the exact radiators you have as long as what you've found is similar.
