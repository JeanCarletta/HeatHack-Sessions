# Boiler thermostat

Your boiler thermostat determines the flow temperature - the temperature of the hot water supplied to your radiators.  If you have a condensing boiler,  then it can recover heat that would otherwise be lost, but this will only work if you run the boiler flow temperature low enough.   Condensing boilers can't recover heat unless the flow temperature is around 70C or below.  The lower the flow temperature (down to 45C), the better the heat recovery works.

Lowering the temperatures is more likely work with generously sized radiators, buildings with lower heat loss, and buildings that are heated most of the day rather than for individual events.  If you have an older building in a reasonable state, you might get away with 60C.   If you have a newer building that's insulated, 50-55C might be more appropriate.  

```{admonition} This advice is sometimes unsuitable
:class: warning

Old, non-condensing boilers wear out faster if you run them at a low temperature.  They are designed to be run at 70C or above. 

If you use a **hot water storage tank**, you need to keep the flow temperature 70C or above to avoid Legionella.  The tank needs temperatures above 60C to kill the bacteria, and there is some heat loss between the boiler and the tank. 

**Fan convectors** usually require higher flow temperatures. This will be specified in the manual.

```{admonition} Is it a condensing boiler?
:class: tip
Condensing boilers have a small white plastic condensate pipe coming out of them, usually at the bottom.  All boilers installed since 2005 are condensing.

<!-- TODO Consider adding boiler modification for hot water.  We’ve read that it’s possible to modify a boiler so it raises the flow temperature only when it’s filling the tank, but it’s less certain that would pay back. -->
