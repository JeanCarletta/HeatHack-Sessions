Here are some innovations that hold promise for our buildings:

- **Wireless programmable TRVs.**  These can provide truly independent room operation via an app or central controller, and for many buildings will be cheaper and much less intrusive (but less robust) than zoning.  There are also cheap TRVs that are programmable via a little display on the TRV itself that might be helpful for buildings with very set schedules.

There are also some innovations that sometimes cause difficulties for us.

- **Modern thermostats that display the temperature.** Many users think with their eyes.  If the display shows a temperature lower than what they think of as normal for their home, they will automatically turn it up, whether they are cold or not - and usually they will just push it as far as it will go, thinking that will heat the space faster.  Although for a well-placed thermostat the same number will always reflect whether the majority of occupants are comfortable, that number doesn't really translate to the same comfort level across different spaces.
