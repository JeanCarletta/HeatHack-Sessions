# Thermal comfort

We heat buildings mostly for the people who use them. That means it's very important to understand what makes people feel comfortable.

Because we're used to controlling heating with thermostats, air temperature is the first thing most people think of, but how people feel depends on much more than the temperature of the air.

The other things that matter are:


- **Temperature of surrounding surfaces (mean radiant temperature).**  We’re all familiar with what heat radiating to us from the sun feels like, but most of the time we’re less aware that when we’re surrounded by cooler surfaces, heat is radiating from us to them. This is just as important to our comfort.   In an insulated modern building, the surfaces warm up quickly. Stone takes a lot of heating before it gets warm, but cools off slowly. 

- **Draughts.** Even a warm draught feels cold.  People vary in how much draughts degrade their comfort, but women tend to feel them more than men.  

- **Relative humidity.** This is the amount of moisture the air has compared to the total amount of moisture it can hold, which varies with the temperature of the air.  The warmer the air is, the more moisture it can hold.  Relative humidity has a range from 0-100%.  When it reaches 100%, moisture falls out of the air.  Too wet or too dry are both uncomfortable, but practically for us, the thing to keep in mind is that if a cold building is also damp, it will make people even less comfortable.  

- **How active the occupants are (metabolic rate).**  If people are running around, they will be comfortable at lower temperatures.  

- **Clothing levels.** Up to a point, more layers of clothing and materials like wool that trap air will also make people comfortable at a lower temperature.

```{admonition} Top Comfort Tip

One of the most important things you can do is ensure consistent, non-draughty conditions so they know how much clothing to bring and don't have to keep changing it while they are in the venue.  People are very adaptable as long as they can predict what they need to do.  This makes it very important to get your heating controls right.  There are so many issues with thermostats in community venues that we offer specific advice about them.
