## Pulling it all together

Scientists try to come up with numbers that reflect how comfortable people will be in terms of what percentage of people will be dissatisfied under which conditions.  That's led to building standards that work well for some buildings.  

In our experience, community buildings almost always fall outside the range that the standards consider comfortable - and yet, people still use these spaces.  The standards don't tell the whole story, especially for buildings made of traditional materials or with natural ventilation.  

There is ongoing research about how people adapt to conditions and how thermal comfort works in a wider range of buildings.  One interesting result is that people are good at adapting - but it's easier for them if conditions don't vary too much so they need to keep changing what to do.  People find temperature swings of more than around 2C very noticeable and uncomfortable.

:class: tip 

The original science behind thermal comfort assessment standards is based on putting six people at a time in a diving bell modified to control temperature, RH, and draughts, and asking them how they feel.
