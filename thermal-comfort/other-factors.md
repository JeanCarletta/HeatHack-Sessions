## Other factors

:TODO: Draughts, Relative Humidity, clothing levels, and level of activity also all have an effect.  Some key points:

- What RH is; inverse relationship between relative humidity and temperature when heating goes on
- comfortable range for RH
- even a warmish draught feels cold
- temperature variation is really annoying because then you have to continually adjust

- RH bounds for preserving the building (e.g., under 80% RH against timber deterioration)
- what church organs require, general guidance for oil paintings etc if we can find it
