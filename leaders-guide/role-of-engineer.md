# The engineer's role

In this programme, the group leader manages the "social" side of the group - organising sessions, introducing topics that the group needs to talk about, and liaising with the property management.  

The engineers take charge of the technical exercises, some work between sessions that makes use of technical information, and asking any questions of our expert advisers or of the network of volunteers, some of whom are very experienced building services engineers. It's useful if they also take on a little of the "social" work, for instance, keeping an eye on the time during the parts of the session they are not leading, writing down anything the group needs to all be able to see, and so on.

Some of the engineers will be operating well away from their core engineering discipline - and we applaud you for that.  We provide reading materials explaining and reinforcing the core concepts.  We give these to everyone involved, but it's particularly useful for you to be comfortable with them.  There will be a chance to ask about them in the training session, but do feel free to ask us about them at any time.  The reading materials include ideas for further reading in case you are interested.  Some of the ideas are very technical.  If you are a building services engineer, you can probably improve on what we say and what we suggest.  We're very happy for you to tell us what we ought to have done.

During the sessions, it may be that you discover issues in the building where it would be helpful to run further investigations - for instance, issues with heat distribution that require thinking about pumpwork or the pipework sizing and configuration in a more complicated boiler room, or checking whether a wall is insulated.  It's useful to identify and document concerns, but this is where your responsibility stops - if you wish to explore further, we are happy to try to facilitate that, but please be mindful of your time so that you don't feel overburdened.  

Because you are not operating in a professional capacity, there is no contractual relationship constraining what you do and say.  Of course you will want to use your skills to help the community, but you are offering your talents just as all other community volunteers do - as one human to others. It's perfectly OK to say you don't know the answer to a question!

:class: tip

Even if you are a building services engineer, you are not providing a professional service as part of the programme.  Neither is HeatHack.  We will stress throughout the programme that this is an exercise that should point them in the right direction, but they need to take professional advice before acting on the results.

One of our core goals in this programme is to demonstrate how useful it is for the groups to include engineers in their community work.   Communities have talented people all around them, but because people have to move around the country to chase work opportunities, it is harder for groups to connect with them than it once was.   Engineers bring a perspective to managing community buildings that is often missing.   Thank you for being involved.
