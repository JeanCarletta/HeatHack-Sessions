# Activity:  Building survey

This activity is a simplified version of what energy efficiency consultants do during a site survey. During it, the group will fill out a form with basic information about the building and take photographs that relate to heating, heat loss, ventilation.

There are two purposes to this activity.  

The first is to familiarise the group with aspects of the building they may never have considered.  Many groups will have members who may only have hazy memories of some spaces and, for instance, never have looked at the windows.  The building might also be completely new to the engineer, although we expect some engineers will have been given a tour when they first matched with a group.

The second is as a memory aid and for some groups, to serve as the only record of some aspects of the building's heating, ventilation, and heat loss features.  Community buildings often lack any documentation of the heating system, for instance.  Even if there is a diagram from the original installer, it will fail to convey its current state.  Surveys often make use of photography to highlight issues and both heating professionals and architects have told us that having them available would help them use their time more effectively.  Pictures may help groups and engineers help each other and also allow us to ask some questions of our Energy Adviser, Andrew Macowan.

:TODO: somewhere put that group leaders should try to get any heating system documentation and floorplans in time for the second session if they can - this could be mentioned in the group leader training.

:TODO: create the form based on Andrew's and maybe some aspects of the CSE one.

In this activity, the group will take photographs that relate to heating, heat loss, ventilation, and energy use.  They will do this either for an entire building, if it is simple, or one of its larger spaces if it is not.  As they work .  They should divide into pairs, but if not enough people have smartphones or cameras, whatever number of groups is possible. How to assign the pairs depends on the building - for instance, ask for pictures of the meters from whoever will be going closest to them.  If the gas meter is outside, that will mean whoever goes outside to look for ventilation; if it is in or near the boiler room, that means whoever is documenting the heating system.

:TODO: get the rest of this right.

There are six main things you are looking from the activity:

- representative pictures of the heat output devices in the space.  Many groups have basic misconceptions about how radiators and other devices work.  This leads to them blocking the air flow on radiators or turning off the fans on fan convectors.  It can also lead to them trying to preheat a space with devices that are only meant to provide localised heating for the comfort of the occupants. 

- pictures of the heating controls in the space, including on electrical appliances.  Many groups don't know if they have a thermostat, whether it is wired in to the current system, and whether it is effective in practice.  Many controls that users can access will allow them to do the wrong things, like turn the heating on (or off) permanently, turn it up to an unaffordable level, or turn on the heating for a system where there's no chance it will improve their comfort for the time they'll be in the space.  Thermostatic radiator valves in community spaces cause real issues for thermal comfort, energy waste, or both.

- representative pictures of the glazing.

- representative pictures of the ventilation features of the building, including outside the building.  They are unlikely to get these right, and some may be in areas they can't access, but this is to get some idea and get them thinking about ventilation as they go about the rest of their business in the building between sessions.

- pictures of the boiler room, if there is one.  These are really for us, to give us some idea of what you're dealing with.    If you are a building services engineer, you may not need assistance with this.  Many community buildings have had single boilers replaced with multi-boiler installations starting in the 1990s, and often these have been plumbed in incorrectly or are under insufficient control.  Some corrections are too expensive to consider until we understand how much future heating will rely on hydrogen - a decision expected to come in 2026 - but it's useful to understand the situation as it will affect decisions about how to stage future changes that rely on "hybrid" heating approaches and what can be said in grant applications.  It's easier to make the case for replacing non-condensing boilers than condensing ones that recover heat from the flue.

- This is also a good time to check that your processes for meter reading are as good as you can achieve.
