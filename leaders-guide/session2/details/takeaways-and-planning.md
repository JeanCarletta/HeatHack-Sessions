# Takeaways and planning

It's useful to gather the photos for the building profile if you can - at least anything you are uncertain about or that you can't easily describe in text.  You will need to determine how you will collect them together to put them on your cloud storage.  

For the next session, you'll also need either the actual diary showing who is in the spaces for a period where you have collected thermal monitoring data, or a diary that shows typical building use over the course of week, for instance, in this format:

- [Google Docs - Building Use Diary Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_3UwlKGqtnaVQqrsQDyNMr6MdldH_sSLpiHTBwC7AbQ/)

It's helpful if you can pass the engineer this information ahead of the session.
