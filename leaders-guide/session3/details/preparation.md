# Session Preparation

# What to bring

Flipchart (or use projection)

# Group leader 

- Large rough floorplan of the building on at least A1 paper (e.g. flipchart paper).  

# Engineer 

It's helpful if the engineer can check for some common heating problems in the traces ahead of the session - for instance, the heating unexpectedly being on at night or for long periods.  We will provide better instructions for this with plots that help spot them in October.
