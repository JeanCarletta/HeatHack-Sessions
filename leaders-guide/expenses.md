# Expenses

Groups are intended not to be out of pocket from engaging in the programme.  We've built in an average of Â£25 of expenses for the groups that are officially supported during our funding period.  Not all groups will need these funds, and some may need more.

The expenses are intended to cover:

- the cost of lithium AA batteries for the thermal monitors. Because of postal regulations, we can't ship them with the monitors.
- costs for the engineer to travel to the sessions - for instance, bus tickets or mileage rates.  Many of the engineers live within walking distance of their chosen venues, but some do not.
- for groups in venues that don't have things stationery items like post-it notes, flipcharts and pens availables, funds to buy these.
- printing costs, although not all groups will have these and the venue might be willing to do small amounts of printing for the group.
