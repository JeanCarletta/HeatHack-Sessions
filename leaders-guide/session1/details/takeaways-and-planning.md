# Takeaways and Planning

- summarise what's going to happen in the other sessions

- do they want to shift the thermal monitor around some spaces (two weeks at each), or leave it in one?  If they move it, they'll want to fill in the Thermal Monitor Location Diary:

    - [Google Docs - Monitor Location Diary Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lb59luV7bnODQef9KC9vKmHjVDsIbQYyRfcX4VaVAA4/)

<!-- :TODO: nice to have, screenshot of diary

- any existing description of who uses the building and the group's values? If it's a church and they've searched for a new rector, vicar, or minister recently, they may have something useful about the community and how the building is used from the profile they constructed for that.  If not, often on the website

-  heating system documentation and floorplans, for second session.

 - arranging to find annual energy consumption from past energy bills - if a church or otherwise part of a larger organisation, someone may already have calculated a year's gas and electricity consumption as part of wider net zero reporting.  I think there's always a summary of annual consumption because suppliers are required by law to give historical information if customers ask (The Electricity and Gas (Billing) Regulations 2014)  It's a pain if all the readings are estimated.


HINT:  for churches, there might be someone in the "green group" or on the property committee who has already done a carbon footprint baseline that required them to get information from past energy bills.
If there is a smart meter, the utility company might give access to the past readings, or at least provide some analysis of them.

 
- :TODO: is going to Canmore ever useful? probably not.
