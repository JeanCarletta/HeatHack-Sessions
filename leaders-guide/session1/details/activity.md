# Activity:  Building orientation

- walk through the spaces to familiarise and discuss priorities in larger buildings where they can't look at everything.

- pictures of the energy meters sufficient to know how to read them and figure out what the current reading is.  Many groups don't know how many meters they have and which show consumption for which areas.  Most groups will never look at consumption on their bills and only think in terms of cost.  If the group needs to take hand readings, smartphone photographs are a good method.  The photograph will time and date the picture automatically. How will they figure out what's on what meter.

- Deciding a meter reading strategy -  :TODO: describe what is useful -  if there's good frequent readings on the bills, or access to smart meter data, OK.  Some might find it easy to take a quick photo weekly because they are passing for other reasons.  Log book at meter, meter readings app, online spreadsheet (we should set this up).

- Deciding a thermal monitoring strategy - just monitor one space, or move it around and keep track of where it is?  Ideal is two weeks of data in each location in each season (acknowledge that's not possible during the project itself.)




```{admonition} Reading meters
:class: tip

You may wonder why we aren't asking groups to read their meters on the spot.  Meters can be hard to read properly, especially older ones.  It's important to know whether gas meters are imperial, in ft3, or metric, in m3, and how to transform that into kW.  For electricity, there may be separate readings for day rates and night rates.  Without access to past bills, it may not be obvious how many meters there are, whether any are submeters, and what areas they serve.  Even just taking photos of the meters with the current readings will be an achievement for many groups.  The meter reading might be obvious when the group comes together at the end of the session, or it might be that some group member needs to take the photo away and figure out what the photo means.

be doing the reading?
