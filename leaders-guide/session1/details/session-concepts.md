# Engineer Talk - Session Concepts

This week's engineer talk lays out some basic concepts that it is important for the group to understand, because they affect which of two major paths a community building might take in future.

:TODO: fundamentals of the talk - What is your building good for?

You will be expecting the programme to be about what to do to your buildings - and it is.  But before you consider that, you have to think about how it is designed and how you intend to use it in future.

Payback is too slow for heat loss mitigations on a building you don't use often, and can't get grants because the community amenity is less.

The majority of the UK's community buildings are older, traditionally built, and in stone. They are also often not in full use.  This raises an issue.  Stone buildings are excellent at damping down the extremes in outside temperature - making it cooler inside during the day/in the spring and warmer inside at night/in the autumn than it would be in a more reactive building - but they are extremely difficult to make warm for a short time.  On the other hand, once the stones are warm, they cool down slowly.  They also are more expensive and more difficult to retrofit with heat loss mitigations, with some uncertainty about the safe ways to do things.

Thermal comfort, effects of surface temperatures, draughts, damp - gives us a way out - localised heating for the people in the space rather than the space heating we're accustomed to.  People are pretty adaptable and avoiding draughts (worse the bigger the difference in temperature between inside and outside!) and keeping buildings dry can be the most important things.  

Promises we need to keep for session 3: "Remind the group of what they learned about localised heating versus space heating, hybrid systems that, for instance, give a low level of background heat and top up with localised solutions, and also about the possibility of reconfiguring the building so it suits community needs better."

Old list:

o Needs to convey the idea that thermal comfort relies not just on air temperatures but also the average of the surrounding surface temperatures, and the surface temperatures in a stone building that is only heated occasionally are always low for comfort.  Stone is a really good material for evening out temperatures over the day and night cycle and over time because of its thermal mass.  For church worship spaces, this is the opposite of what they want – they are coldest at around 8 am and warmest at around 6 pm.
o Single glazed window surfaces are always cold; if you’re sitting next to one that’s a lot of what influences your comfort.
o Draughts are also important (including downdraughts off cold windows, a double whammy of discomfort), and damp makes people feel worse.
o People always think of increasing the air temperature (= thermostat) to make a place more comfortable, but it’s expensive, and more expensive the higher you go.  The way most people run their homes, reducing the thermostat by a degree will save around 10% of the energy/bill.  For most community buildings, it will be more.
o There are other ways of making people comfortable:
 More clothes!  Temperature expectations only ever go up (and there are requirements for some things, like 16C for registered child care).
 Heat the people, not the space! By making some surface near them a bit warm (under pew heaters, pew cushions) or a farther surface very warm (radiant heaters).
 Make changes to the building so it loses less heat – insulation, and so on - but that's only a reasonable thing to do if you have enough users to justify a grant or other ways of paying the expense, and it's only needed if you use space heating.
 Use the building more so you can justify putting more energy into it, making and keeping? the stone warmer and people more comfortable at the same
