# Session 1 - Basic concepts

Session 1 introduces some core concepts relating to thermal comfort, thermal mass/difficulty if not heating a lot; where heat loss occurs; how cost of addressing that is unaffordable unless building has high occupancy; localised heating vs space heating; what buildings with localised heating really need is to stay dry more than anything, so you need to think about how the moisture gets in there and how to get it out 

:TODO: fix introduction and whatever we need to comment about the contents (for this document).  The summary sheet is what they will actually use during the session.  Session-outlines.docx contains the correct format for this session although it might be too ambitious; this guide does not have the right stuff yet.  Note that the activity is just basic photographs/survey information and e.g. where the worst draughts are in their experence, not attempts to measure anything.

## Special preparation for the facilitator

ask the property manager if there is any documentation of the heating system or any architectural diagrams they can use.  This could take the form of past invoices for work done, documentation or user manuals for equipment.  For churches, architectural diagrams could be in the quinquennial report or in the archives.

Flipchart/big pen, whiteboard, pack of post-it notes, or projector attached to a laptop with a text editor (e.g. Microsoft Word)

## Things for the group to bring

binoculars, opera glasses; smart phones, tablets, or digital cameras.
