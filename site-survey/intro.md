# Conducting a site survey

- read energy meters https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumer/energy/energy-supply/your-energy-meter/how-to-read-your-energy-meter/ - be careful, gas meters can be in either ft3 or m3. Which yours is will be marked clearly on the facade.

- finding annual energy consumption from past energy bills - if you are a church or otherwise part of a larger organisation, someone may already have calculated a year's gas and electricity consumption as part of wider net zero reporting.  I think there's always a summary of annual consumption because suppliers are required by law to give historical information if customers ask (The Electricity and Gas (Billing) Regulations 2014)

- photographic survey of the heating and ventilation and areas of major heat loss in the building.
