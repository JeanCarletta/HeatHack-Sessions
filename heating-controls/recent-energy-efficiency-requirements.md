# Modern energy efficiency requirements

Installers tend to put them in and leave it to you to figure out how to use them. It's genuinely difficult.




- Optimised start control particularly useful for places that are heated per event because otherwise (at least in older buildings) you have to at least vary the warm-up time by season and really, try to predict based on weather forecast.  OSC judges when to come on using external temperature sensor or from the indoor temperature plus how fast the temperature has been changing.  It can't get stuff perfect (weather is changeable, wind and sun can have big effects) but it's as good as a person doing the predictions and a lot easier (then anyone with the building diary can set the heat).

- Weather compensation, the more you use the building the more likely useful

- load compensation - not so important for slow systems like old cast iron radiators, good for fan convectors.

More recent systems add further energy efficiency requirements that don't affect what the building user sees, but do affect how to set the heating - these are described briefly on the heating controls card for the game in session 2.
