# The third session introduces reasoning skills to understand automatic and end user heating controls. Even thermostatic
# radiator valves are not intuitive for most people. Workmen often set weather compensators inappropriately for this
# application. The materials introduce types of controls, some common problems, and techniques for diagnosing them. In
# the session, groups will plan how to check their system as well as considering how the controls interact with each other.
# They may request access to e.g. HeatHack pipe temperature sensors if required. In more complex systems, it is often not
# obvious how to optimise efficiency. The session will impart enough understanding for groups to commission and snag
# heating systems, holding the professionals to account, with discussion about how this works.
