# Understanding users

General observations:

1.   users will always find a way to make themselves comfortable - what's hard is making sure the one they find first doesn't waste energy or create safety hazards. Bring in space heaters; turning on all burners and the oven in a kitchen; prop open doors, usually with fire extinguishers, and forget to close them afterwards.

2. Good communication helps tremendously - users generally want to do the right thing, but they need to know who to talk to if they aren't comfortable.  In unstaffed buildings especially if they don't know who to ask they will assume they are meant to find their own solutions. 

3. Any signage for them has to be very large print with very few words - like, 3 - and pictures work a whole lot better.

4. If they're hot, they know how to open windows and doors, but they might not know how to turn the heating down - you have to make it as easy as possible for them.  

5. with any thermostatic control, they believe that if they turn it to the maximum, the space will heat up faster.  For this reason, it's great if you can find a way to limit the top temperature to something reasonable rather than the industry standard of 26C.

6. The controls we can buy are designed either for households or buildings that are in higher occupancy than many of our spaces, so they allow users to do the wrong things - very careful choice can make a big difference to your users' comfort and your bills.  

:TODO: Sidebar - boiler thermostat.  There's only one way to make the system heat up faster, and that's to increase the temperature of the hot water in the pipes.  The thermostat for this is on the boiler.  Safety implications (LST radiators) but generally want this high if you heat occasionally, and lower if you heat the building for long periods.  (Will need a sidebar at some point to say, "your installer probably doesn't get this at all - they only do offices and houses, completely different, will use the wrong default settings.")
