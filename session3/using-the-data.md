# Using the thermal monitoring data

:TODO: write this advice properly, this is email dump.

Energy consumption is useful to get under lots of circumstances.  In summer, places with multi-boiler installations have often been told "leave them on all the time",  but there can be a lot of hot water circulating around the boiler room just in case the temperature drops below setpoint. Special weeks when some spaces are empty are great for estimating energy costs associated with different kinds of room use, an important part of setting costs for room hires.  In the past we've had to resort to meter log books and timelapse photography but the lucky groups will have smart meters with companies that will give them access to the data.  We don't know how common this is yet.
