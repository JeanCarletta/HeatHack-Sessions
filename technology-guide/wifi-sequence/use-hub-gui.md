You should now see the hub's interface.  Choose "Configure Wifi", and choose the venue's guest wifi network from the list.  If you don't see it, refresh the list by choosing "Scan".  Then enter the wifi password and choose "Save".

Some venues deliberately hide the wifi network - in this case you can type in it's name (SSID).  You may be able to look up the name using a phone you have used on the wifi before or on the back of the router. 

If heathackhub disappears from your list of connections, the hub is now successfully connected to the internet.   Otherwise you may have entered the wrong password - please try again.  

Now turn on the sensor unit.  The hub has a blue LED just visible through the case that will flash every time it receives data from the sensor unit.  This will happen every 10 seconds for 2 minutes so that you can check it is working, and then less frequently.
