To check that the hub is working, connect to the guest wifi network and use your browser to go to the thingspeak.com address printed on your box.  You will see three very basic graphs - we will produce better ones later.  You should see a recent very low reading (1C and 1%RH).  We use this to know when the connection happens.

You can now leave the sensor unit and hub unattended.  If anyone turns them off, they will start working again when you turn them back on.  You may wish to leave a note on the hub, as cleaners often remove them.
