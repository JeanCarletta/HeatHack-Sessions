Once you have started the device, you will get a notification that a file has been downloaded it.  Send it to this by email to data@heathack.org.  If you open the file, you may have an option to "share" it, or you can open your email, start a message to us, and attach it to the message.  The file is named "datalog.csv", but there may also be a number if you've downloaded before.  You want the most recent one.

We hope to process these emails automatically - please don't include any other information in the email.  If you need a human's attention, email help@heathack.org.
