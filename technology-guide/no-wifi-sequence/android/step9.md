Configure the device by identifying its next location.  Use your site id followed by a hyphen and a word that will remind you where it is (example:  ccm-nave, ccm-hall).
When you press "download data and start", your phone will download a file containing the data.  You have four minutes to do this but the battery will last longer if you are faster.

:TODO: retake picture with a proper location id.

:TODO: find out what happens if you do nothing.

:TODO:  write the sequence for how to email the file on Android.  Is the experience always the same?
