# Instructions for no wifi version

If your premises don't have wifi, your sensor unit saves the data for you to retrieve and email to us for processing.  You should do this every week or two, or else its memory will fill up.  You'll probably want to use a smartphone to do this, but you could instead use a tablet or laptop. The sensor unit starts recording data again automatically.

It's much easier to do this somewhere with wifi first - like your home - because you'll be able to read these instructions as you go.  If you happen to have two devices that can connect to the internet, you can read the instructions on one and retrieve the data on the phone you will take with to to the venue.  The second time you retrieve the data, your phone will already have some of the details saved.

If you read the instructions on the same device as you will use to connect, you will need to go back and forth between the wifi settings and the browser.  This can usually be done using the "Home" button.
