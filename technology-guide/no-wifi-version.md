# Instructions for no wifi version

If your premises don't have wifi, your sensor unit saves the data for you to retrieve and email to us for processing.  You should do this every week or two, or else its memory will fill up.  You'll probably want to use a smartphone to do this, but you could instead use a tablet or laptop. The sensor unit starts recording data again automatically.

It's much easier to do this somewhere with wifi first - like your home - because you'll be able to read these instructions as you go.  

If you have two devices, read the instructions on one and follow them on whatever you will be using at the venue.  Your device will remember some of the details, making it easier a second time.  If you don't have two devices, then it will easier if you use the PDF instructions.
