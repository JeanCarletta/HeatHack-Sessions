# Starting the sensor

When you turn on the batteries in your sensor box, it will start an internet hotspot that you can connect to using
a smartphone or tablet.  

It will appear as a new wifi network called heathack.  It takes about 30 seconds to appear and then stays up for 4 minutes in case you want to connect to it.  The password is written on the box.

Once you have connected, type 192.168.4.1 into the web browser address bar to control the device.  :TODO: is this also limited to 4 minutes?  You can set the start the device collecting data.  When you do, the device will then load a web page with data the device

When you set up the device, it asks you for the name of the location - this is because you can move it around your premises, for instance, if you have more than one space.  Make sure to get the location right, and if you use the same location twice, try to enter exactly the same name.  We use these names to get the data to the right graphs.

If you find 4 minutes to short, get your phone or tablet ready ahead of time by putting the number in the browser address bar and having the wifi settings page open before you put the battery in.  You can try this a few times at home if you like!
