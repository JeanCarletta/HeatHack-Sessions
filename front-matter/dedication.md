# Dedication

This programme is dedicated to the Boston Womenâ€™s Health Collective.  Since the 1970s, they have been empowering women to collaborate in their own health care.  This is oddly similar to what we want to achieve!  It is also dedicated to volunteers everywhere helping to look after our community buildings.
