 # Introduction

Knowing how to manage energy use in community buildings and halls is difficult.  Many of us manage the most difficult buildings in our local areas, especially if they are churches or ex-church buildings.  We are, for the most part, volunteers who know our buildings well, but have no training that helps us understand how the energy systems in our buildings work and how to change them for the better.  Meanwhile, there are few professionals who spend enough of their working lives thinking about community buildings or older premises and able to provide us with confident advice.  This means sometimes we are told things that are more appropriate for modern construction, houses, offices, schools, and factories.  Even when the professionals have time to think deeply about our needs, sometimes the equipment then can buy is designed with very different buildings in mind.  Itâ€™s understandable, then, that we might not be getting the best service from the energy we put into our buildings.

Now that energy is expensive and we understand that we need to move to net zero to reduce the harmful impacts of climate change, it is more important than ever not to waste energy.  Getting this right will help our buildings and the services provided within them continue to survive, and we hope, even to thrive.  

This programme is designed to help you understand energy use in your premises and what net zero means for you.  We hope you find the programme useful in your journey, and that together we can build a better future for all of us.
