# Why Engineering?

This programme is unusual for ones run in churches, because it introduces what may be a new kind of specialist to your group: an engineer.  Engineers use science to solve problems.  They're also good at thinking about time and budget constraints, because the whole point of engineering is to make things that work in the real world. It can be useful to have an engineer involved when you're thinking about your property just because of the way they are trained to think about problems and potential solutions.  You should come away from the programme with a new appreciation of engineering and, we hope, able to think a little bit like engineers do.  

:TODO:  ask Engineers without Borders or the RAE for help sourcing some nice diverse pictures.
