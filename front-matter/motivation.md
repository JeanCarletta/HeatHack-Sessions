# Why take part?

This programme assumes your group needs to understand what a net zero future means for your premises.  For some groups, this need will arise from a deeply felt ethical concern for the planet and its inhabitants.  For others, it arises because of pressure from above, for instance, as church hierarchies make policies requiring net zero action plans.  For some, volatile and rising energy prices will be foremost in their minds, or the dwindling resources of an aging or declining community.  All of these are perfectly valid reasons for taking part. 


This programme is not the place to debate whether climate change exists or whether human behaviour has the power to affect its course for good or ill.  It is also not the place to have detailed discussions about climate change and its effects on the planet, although if that is your main interest, you may wish to consider our sister programmes, Climate Conversations and Conversations for Change.  Our programme is about how to get the most benefit out of the energy you put into your buildings and how to have what are difficult discussions about whether that energy use can be supported financially and justified ethically in your place and at this time.   It is based loosely on our experiences in running Carbon Conversations, structured discussion groups about how to achieve reductions in the carbon impacts of our personal lives.  


Much of the programme isn't technical at all - it's discussion about what your building is for and how it should be used and managed in the future.  For this, towards the end, you'll need to engage with others in your local community.  After all, it's space that serves them.  This kind of conversation will be a new one to many groups, and so the programme is designed to equip you for that, too, by showing you some good ways to engage the people you serve. You should come out of the programme with a plan for your building and evidence that will be useful for securing grant funding if you need it.
