# About this programme

This programme has been developed based on experiences within HeatHack, a group of community volunteers and students in Edinburgh that have been helping churches understand how to heat their buildings better.  HeatHack has previously been funded by the John Templeton Foundation via Scientists in Congregations Scotland, with small contributions from the University of Edinburgh Schools of Informatics and Engineering, and the University of St Andrews School of Computer Science.  

It has been developed and is being run in conjunction with The Surefoot Effect, a Community Interest Company that helps communities, businesses and governments put sustainability and resilience at the heart of what they do, and with support from Engineers without Borders UK to help find engineers for community groups who cannot find them for themselves.

The programme would not be possible without the generous support of the Royal Academy of Engineering through their Ingenious public engagement programme.
