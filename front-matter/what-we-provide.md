# What we provide

This is not a textbook, but an initial guide based on our past experiences with community buildings in Edinburgh and the surrounding area.  We will support you through the programme.  For instance, we have in mind helping you compare notes with other, similar groups and letting you ask questions in "Meet the Expert" sessions with some of our advisers, or for us to research and blog.  Based on what we learn from you and how you find the programme, we will adapt what we have to make it better.  Our goal at the end of the current programme is to put out resources that anyone can use.  Towards the end of the programme we will also ask you what we should be doing next.

To help you understand your buildings, we will provide you with a small device you can put in your spaces that will collect regular temperature and relative humidity readings.  You do not need to know how they work, but with the aid of your groupâ€™s engineer, you will learn how to spot some basic problems on the data they provide.  We also have a limited amount of specialist equipment available by post for those who need it to look at specific issues.  The data our equipment collects, along with other information you will be collecting, will form a profile of your premises and how you use them.
