# Who should be in the group

<!-- :TODO: start again here -->

To participate, you will need to have six people who want to be involved, plus the active interest of the buildingâ€™s owners or management.  This group should be varied and represent the range of people who have an interest in the building.  Depending on your circumstances, this might include:

- people who manage the property and know about things like maintenance and heating
- people who hire one or more of the spaces
- people in a position to know the user community as a whole 
- people who know the local community well and are well-networked
- people involved in making decisions on behalf of the organisation
- people who might struggle to use your facilities, for instance, because of disability
- people responsible for thinking about the organisation's response to the climate crisis

Your choice really will depend on local circumstances.  As long as your building has at least six people who care enough about what happens to it in the future to take part and the owners or managers are receptive to change, the programme is for you.


We also **highly recommend** that your group include an engineer.  

```{note}
If you are participating in our Royal Academy of Engineering-supported programme, your group must have an engineer.  If you are unsure whether someone is an engineer, ask them!
Most engineers will have a university degree in engineering or have been an engineering apprentice, but there are others who have learned what they know by other routes, and they are welcome on our programme.
