# Group sessions

The programme takes the form of a set of four group sessions that build up to a shared understanding of what the best way forward is for these premises in this community.

:TODO: simplify the summaries and make them more English perhaps.

- **Session 1.** Getting to know each other and the project, exploring (with engineer input) why it is hard to heat community buildings and what Net Zero means for this space.  Determining where and placing the thermal monitor and arranging how we will get meter readings. Beginning to pool what we know about the building and how it is used and identifying actions to fill gaps.  Looking forward to what this space could be like in the future.

- **Session 2.** Learning more about heat efficiency and heat loss.  Do a ‘building walk around’ to create a photograph survey and record of building’s current heating, heat loss, and ventilation features and to start thinking about potential solutions.  Using cards specially designed for this project, explore potential options for improving energy performance in this space.

- **Session 3.** Looking at the outcome of the thermal monitoring against the building occupancy to identify issues.  Learning more about heating controls.  Review solutions identified in Session 2 and match them with issues to create a list of recommendations.  Look in detail at how the building is used and consider whether changes are required for the future, including changes to the building to accommodate what the community needs.  Begin discussing how to engage the wider community.

- **Session 4.** Finalising the list of recommendations.  Planning an event to involve the rest of the community in taking the recommendations forward.

Reaching a shared vision is hard!   There are some thorny ethical issues and a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to what net zero means for the future.  People differ in their perceptions and values, and emotions count too! It's important in any community work to be in agreeement about how a group should conduct itself.  For our sessions, we use the "A Recipe" approach for this:

- **A** --- Avoid assumptions
- **R** --- Respect each other
- **E** --- Everyone’s contribution counts
- **C** --- Confidentiality
- **I** --- I speak for myself
- **P** --- Pass if you have nothing you wish to say  
- **E** --- Expect to participate

You can suggest other points to agree on if that seems useful in your circumstances.
