For groups participating in the Royal Academy of Engineering-funded programme, it is free of charge, including our card game pack and one of our volunteer-built thermal monitors.  You may face some incidental expenses for items like batteries and stationery, and you can charge these to expenses.  Your volunteer engineer may also charge mileage costs for attending sessions.  We have budgeted for an average of £25 in expenses for each group.

If you have staff participate, we are unable to cover the cost of their time.  We also cannot pay for room hire for running your sessions or for heating your venue so that the group will be comfortable.  We recognise that these can be relatively large expenses.  Please note that you can be inventive about where you meet and when you do activities like the site survey that definitely require venue access.  Many of these are relatively brief and involve moving around, which will keep people warmer.

We are happy to discuss new programmes. The most expensive part is administration - recruiting groups, for instance.  We are willing to work with organisations that wish to do administration in-house and just supply the services you need to make it work.  We are also happy to apply for funding in partnership with, or at least with the support of, organisations that have venues they would like to have undertake the programme.
We are also happy to try to help groups that are not part of organised programmes.

Our materials are all freely accessible online without charge but there are still some unavoidable "per group" costs. Here are our estimates:

- **Thermal Monitor**. These are very important for discovering whether you can save energy by inexpensive changes to the current heating system and how you operate it, often leading to very quick financial savings.  Commercial data loggers cost around £45 for one that saves temperature readings to a USB stick, or £70 if you have any concerns about damp or dryness so need to include relative humidity.  They come with a battery that lasts around a year.  Many venues find them worth the investment, but it is more convenient to have the readings go straight to the internet, which is more expensive to buy. If you know an electronics hobbyist, our thermal monitor can be built from parts for under £10, including the £5 battery. It can save readings for you to pick up with a smartphone or send them to the internet.  We are looking at whether we can scale up the volunteer effort to produce them, but they will not be a commercial product that is suitable for sale and postage adds £1.50.  We currently pay £300 a year for internet hosting for all venues with wifi access for their thermal monitors.  This is very convenient for us and for the groups, but that would add £6 per monitor per year, or more if not many venues participate.  It is possible for groups to set up their own free data hosting instead.

- **Card Game**.  The HeatHack Card Game requires physical cards.  It costs us around £13.50 per double-sided pack for us to print a bunch and have a volunteer post you one.  It would cost you around £3.50 to print them on normal paper, but they wouldn't hold up well to handling. 

- **Printing and stationery**.  Groups vary in how much printing they do, but it's very useful to be able to print a few copies of the site survey form, and if you don't have a projector you will need some other pieces to hand during sessions.  Sticky notes and a flip chart are also very useful.  We estimate the total cost as well under £10.

- **Training.** Many groups will want to have live training and we would need to pay trainers to deliver this.   Please discuss your needs with us so we can work out what to do.
