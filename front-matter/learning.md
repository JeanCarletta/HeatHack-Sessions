# What you will learn

In the programme, you will learn 

* about thermal comfort, where the temperature a thermostat shows is not the whole story, and what this means for deciding how you use your spaces, with different heat strategies for occasional and frequent use.  

* the basics of how heating systems work and how to check whether your current heating systems are fit for purpose and working correctly.  

* about ventilation, why ventilation is important for the health of the building and its occupants, and the relationship between ventilation and heat loss.

* where the big heat losses in community buildings occur and the measures that can sometimes be taken to reduce them

* about local generation options like solar panels and lower carbon heating options like heat pumps that might be suitable for your buildings

* how to stage changes to move towards lower carbon if you can't afford everything in one go.

Parts of the programme might sound highly technical, but we will keep it simple.  We aren't trying to make you into an engineer or heating specialist.  The programme is about equipping you with the information about your building and the knowledge that you need to get better outcomes when you engage professionals.  

Most of our past experience is with traditionally built, stone buildings, particularly churches.  These throw up some particular challenges, so we will spend some time addressing those.  If you find some materials do not apply in your case, feel free to skip these parts of the programme.
