## Localised Heating

Just drift the heat past people - warm something heats air, convects past people giving them some heat by conduction.  Has to be pretty warm air for it not to feel cold.  Trench heating, warm floor even better, some heat by conduction and a big radiant surface.  Examples:  Pew cushions, hot water bottle, heated car seat, tubular heating under pews.

Stoves.  St Mary's cathedral, if you want to be warm you sit next to a radiator!

Advantage: better bang for the buck (and the planet)
