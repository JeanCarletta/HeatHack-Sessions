## Surrounding surfaces 

The temperature of the surrounding surfaces is just as important as the air temperature for how people feel.  To understand why, we need a very basic scientific concept:  *heat transfer*. One of the ways that heat can transfer from a warm object to a cooler one is by *radiation*, or electromagnetic wave.

Radiation in the sun

The sun is very hot, and heat transfers from it to the surfaces around it, no matter how far away they are.

The person is warmer than the surrounding surfaces, so heat transfers from the person to the building.

We're all familiar with what heat radiating from the sun feels like, but we're less aware that when we're surrounded by cooler surfaces, heat is radiating from us to them.  Surfaces don't have to be very warm to keep us comfortable, but very cold ones are very noticeable.

The average temperature of the surrounding surfaces is called the *mean radiant temperature*.  In comfort assessments, it is just as important as the air temperature.  


```{admonition} Fun Fact!
  :class: hint
Mean radiant temperature is measured by putting a temperature sensor inside a matte black globe because that absorbs radiation instead of reflecting it.  Sometimes people make them from copper toilet floats or ping pong balls. That's practical engineering -  cost-effective and based on science!

:TODO: get this layout to work, apparently with https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/; check PDF build; figure out how we get attribution to pop up when it's a figure and remove figure number OR figure out how to use an image in a panel instead.
