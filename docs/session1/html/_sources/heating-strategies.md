# Heating strategies
Churches were never meant to be comfortable in the modern sense of the word, but they varied in terms of what their heating systems were meant to achieve.  

Some were meant to provide a background level of heating throughout the winter, but no more than that - a lot like heating a chicken shed.  

Some were meant to be brought up to a less frigid air temperature for use, not warming the building itself - but more like 12-14C air temp than modern expectations.  

In both these cases, there are sometimes fewer radiators now than there were, because they were in the way - so people took them out, not realising the effect on the heating (this is really session2?)

Some were meant to make the people right next to them more comfortable, but not really warm the space properly.  Lots of these are gone - internal combustion stoves.

It's useful to think about what the building was designed to do, especially if you still have elements of the original (or at least early) heating system in place.  So, how would we know?  Looking at your older equipment will give you some clues.  But first we have to introduce the two remaining methods of heat transfer: *conduction* and *convection*.
