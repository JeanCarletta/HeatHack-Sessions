## Pulling it all together

:TODO: fill in sketch  

Scientists try to come up with numbers that reflect how comfortable people will be in terms of what percentage of people will be dissatisfied under which conditions.  That's led to building standards for offices, but the work for churches has never been done.

The core science behind thermal comfort assessment standards are based on putting six people at a time in a diving bell modified to control temperature, RH, and draughts, and asking them how they feel.
