# HeatHack Session 3

:TEMP:
The third session introduces reasoning skills to understand automatic and end user heating controls. Even thermostatic
radiator valves are not intuitive for most people. Workmen often set weather compensators inappropriately for this
application. The materials introduce types of controls, some common problems, and techniques for diagnosing them. In
the session, groups will plan how to check their system as well as considering how the controls interact with each other.
They may request access to e.g. HeatHack pipe temperature sensors if required. In more complex systems, it is often not
obvious how to optimise efficiency. The session will impart enough understanding for groups to commission and snag
heating systems, holding the professionals to account, with discussion about how this works.
