:TODO: get the build working to put the outputs in this docs directory automatically - probably works in Linux - or use ghp-import to get into a separate branch like we'll want eventually.

:TODO: figure out how to generate something acceptable that links to html and pdf for each part.  We are generating them separately so that we don't have to distribute them all
at once to everyone and so that when we do a PDF for the entire set together, we can get each chapter on a new page (said to be a problem otherwise).
