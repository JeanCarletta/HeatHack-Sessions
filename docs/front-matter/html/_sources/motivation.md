# Why take part?

This programme assumes your group needs to understand what a net zero future means for your premises.  For some groups, this need will arise from a deeply felt ethical concern for the planet and its inhabitants.  For others, it arises because of pressure from above, as church hierarchies make policies requiring net zero action plans.  For some, volatile and rising energy prices will be foremost in their minds, or the dwindling resources of an aging congregation.  All of these are perfectly valid reasons for taking part.

This programme is not the place to debate whether climate change exists or whether human behaviour has the power to affect its course for good or ill.  It is also not the place to have detailed discussions about climate change and its effects on the planet, although if that is your main interest, you may wish to consider our sister programme, Climate Conversations.  Our programme is about how to get the most benefit out of the energy you put into your buildings and how to have what are difficult discussions about whether that energy use can be supported financially and justified ethically in your place and at this time.   It is based loosely on our experiences in running Carbon Conversations, structured discussion groups about how to achieve reductions in the carbon impacts of our personal lives.
