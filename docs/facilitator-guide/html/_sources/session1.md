# Session 1

## Ice Breaker

## Discussion

Can you remember your first impressions of this building? What did it used to be like and how was it used?  
If you know anything about the history of your building, how how that changed over the years?  Is the heating you have now even worse than the original? How do you use the building now, and how does it match the design?

## Exercise

## Discussion 

The average house in Britain is heated to 22C :TODO: find reference.  What was the heating like in your house as a child growing up?  How have norms changed?  How do you think they might change in future?
