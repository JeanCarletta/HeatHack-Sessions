# Introduction

- Cheap devices we built to measure temperature and relative humidity, parts cost about Â£7 each.

- you have a sensor box to configure and place somewhere representative in your main space

- if you also have wifi, you have a device that has to be plugged in but doesn't need to be somewhere representative of the temperature.  It receives readings from the sensor box by radio and forwards them to the internet for storage.
