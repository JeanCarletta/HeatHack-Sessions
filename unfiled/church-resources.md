Church buildings have received special consideration just because they are so difficult. 

- TODO:  fast variations in temperature are bad for the building and its contents, especially the organ, but it's very difficult to heat them slowly if it's just once a week.  Also be very careful of organs during the installation and snagging of new heating systems.  It's depressingly common for organs to get damaged by installers turning the heating on and leaving it running uncontrolled 24/7 until they have an electrician available or because there's just much more heat reaching the organ - you have to watch carefully during any major change in how you operate the building.
