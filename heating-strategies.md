# Heating strategies
:PROBLEM:  we can go one of two ways - thermal comfort is already heading towards whether the building is meant to be heated/whether heating is meant to be local, and it's useful to introduce this in session 2, because it's a big part of what they're going to be thinking about throughout.  This way in:  

Exercise: reference says that the average house in Britain is heated to 22C.  What was the heating like in your house as a child growing up?

Sketch of way 1:  Churches were never meant to be comfortable in the modern sense of the word, but they varied in terms of what their heating systems were meant to achieve.  

Some were meant to provide a background level of heating throughout the winter, but no more than that - a lot like heating a chicken shed.  

Some were meant to be brought up to a less frigid air temperature for use, not warming the building itself - but more like 12-14C air temp than modern expectations.  

In both these cases, there are sometimes fewer radiators now than there were, because they were in the way - so people took them out, not realising the effect on the heating (this is really session2?)

Some were meant to make the people right next to them more comfortable, but not really warm the space properly.  Lots of these are gone - internal combustion stoves.

It's useful to think about what the building was designed to do, especially if you still have elements of the original (or at least early) heating system in place.  So, how would we know?  Looking at your older equipment will give you some clues.  But first we have to introduce the two remaining methods of heat transfer: *conduction* and *convection*.

Associated exercise:  what do we know about our building and how it was used from older people in our community?  From photographs and archives?  Is the heating you have now even worse than the original? How do you use the building now, and how does it match the design?





#(We introduce them because the general argument is conduction works great for heating - so we can bring in pew cushions and underfloor heating in session 4.)

## localised heating

Just drift the heat past people - warm something heats air, convects past people giving them some heat by conduction.  Has to be pretty warm air for it not to feel cold.  Trench heating, warm floor even better, some heat by conduction and a big radiant surface.  Pew cushions, tubular heating under pews.

Stoves.  St Mary's cathedral, if you want to be warm you sit next to a radiator!

Advantage: better bang for the buck (and the planet)
