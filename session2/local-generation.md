# Generating energy on your premises

Less important than reducing demand.

## Solar panels

initial thoughts about content: 

* popular for community buildings as a way of showing their values, popular target for donated funds (people like visible outcomes)
* most useful for buildings that have high daytime power use or a big battery for storage (expensive), but can feed into national grid (needs an inverter, extra cost)
* in community buildings, usually solar PV to generate electricity, not solar panels that make hot water (although if there's a way to feed some background heat into the building I wonder if that's so stupid, Ian Arbon's arguments about hot water as an energy store)
* needs a sound roof - can be a problem on old slates, nail sickness and roof has to face a useful direction, not be shaded by other buildings, be the right slant, ... (find a link for assessments)
* if listed or conservation area, panels might not be allowed if they will be visible from the street or from any important vantage points. 
* working at height is expensive
* there are coops that will put solar panels on your roof with modest returns for their members, if you can't afford to do it yourself - or if your building isn't suitable, joining the coop instead is a less visible way of showing your values
