# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

## Pulling it all together

If the heating is on frequently, the building itself will warm up, making the internal surfaces the same temperature as the air inside.  How frequent depends on how well the building retains heat - something we'll look at in session 2. 

:TODO: check session reference and decide whether need to say here already that stone retains heat pretty well.
# Why isn't air temperature a good indication of thermal comfort in our buildings?

In a modern, well-insulated building that is heated all the time, the air will warm up the building materials so that the air temperature and the surface temperatures will be much the same.  This isn't true for most church buildings.  It takes a great deal of energy to heat all that massive stonework.  Unless they are heated frequently, it remains cooler, making the inhabitants feel less warm than the thermostat setting would suggest.


``` {sidebar} Thermal Mass

Thermal mass is the ability of a material to absorb, store and release heat.  Dense materials like brick and stone have high thermal mass - they can absorb a lot of heat - but they absorb and release it slowly.  

:TODO:  what picture?

Thermal mass can work to a building's advantage.  In places where night is much cooler than daytime, it helps keep a building a steady temperature because the building can heat up the sun during the day and then release it when it is needed.  Unfortunately, it tends to work against what most churches want, as it makes it particularly cold inside in the morning.

:TODO:  

:TODO:  ask Roger about old practices of airing the building on a good dry spring day - something I read was concerned about creating condensation inside the building.
