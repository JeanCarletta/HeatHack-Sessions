# Session 2 - How much heating do we need?

:TEMP:
The second session showcases engineering approaches to estimation by considering heating requirements and possible
changes including heat loss mitigations. This requires the group to estimate space volume, the output of heat distribution
systems and heating appliances, and for heat loss, surface areas by material. It is common for the heating appliances to
produce far more output than the available distribution can shed, especially in worship spaces. The preparatory materials
may include simulations and the technical exercise can be worksheet-based. Discussion includes barriers to change and
how people feel about the effect on the space.

Promises from session 1:  looking at how well building retains heat.  So we'll need thermal mass.

## Pulling it all together

If the heating is on frequently, the building itself will warm up, making the internal surfaces the same temperature as the air inside.  How frequent depends on how well the building retains heat - something we'll look at in session 2. 

:TODO: check session reference and decide whether need to say here already that stone retains heat pretty well.
