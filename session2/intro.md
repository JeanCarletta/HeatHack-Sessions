# Session 2 - Moving to net zero

:TODO:  ask Roger about old practices of airing the building on a good dry spring day - something I read was concerned about creating condensation inside the building.

<!-- :TEMP:
The second session showcases engineering approaches to estimation by considering heating requirements and possible
changes including heat loss mitigations. This requires the group to estimate space volume, the output of heat distribution
systems and heating appliances, and for heat loss, surface areas by material. It is common for the heating appliances to
produce far more output than the available distribution can shed, especially in worship spaces. The preparatory materials
may include simulations and the technical exercise can be worksheet-based. Discussion includes barriers to change and
how people feel about the effect on the space. -->

Last week, learned about thermal comfort and thought about what the heating is doing for comfort in the buildings.

There's really steps before this - CSE idea of addressing reducing energy use:

1. Reduce demand
2. Reduce losses
3. Generate

Many resources for this, our approach is not to compete with them, but to point to appropriate ones and importantly, to comment where they are missing important insights for our buildings.

CSE figure about where most energy in community buildings goes.  (Might be before LED lighting, see if there's a more up to date one or just comment that it will be even more skewed now).

Note importance of thinking about heating.  

One of the most important hidden issues relates to what we talked about last week:  if a building is only occasionally occupied, the biggest way of of reducing demand is to move from space heating to localised heating or hybrid arrangements.

Particularly important to make this kind of decision because it impacts step 2, reducing losses - which really only apply to spaced heated buildings, not economical (in financial or carbon terms) to worry about secondary glazing/insulation if you're only heating the people.

IMPORTANT: heat pumps as low temperature, heating all the time for a background level of heat, often need more than one domestic to heat fully but the commercial ones are expensive.
