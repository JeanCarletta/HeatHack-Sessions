# Types of radiators

Although they're called "radiators", mostly radiators **convect** heat - air passes over them, warms, and rises because it's warmer, transferring the heat into the room.

Radiators are often placed under windows to counteract the opposite effect when the room's air passes the glass.  Window glass is cold, so this air cools and falls down into the room.  If there is a radiator under the window, this helps avoid that air movement creating a draught.
