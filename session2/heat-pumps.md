# Heat pumps

:TODO: we don't want to say any more than we have to - maybe we don't have to say anything, there's some fact sheet about all this stuff they can read.

Heat pumps run at a lower temperature, and so require heat output covering a bigger surface area.  Underfloor heating is ideal because it is then out of the way and comfortably in contact with the users.
