# Heat Loss

glazing options

secondary glazing outside, air gap

curtains

shutters

:TODO: on site survey, suggest borrow thermal imaging camera from Council, describe why not an engineering assessment, talk about using spot laser devices as a cheap option (not the same as ones for measuring Covid temperature, and be careful not to heat up handle in repeat measurements)

There's probably a better source, but I think really keen engineers can get a sense of where the worst heat loss is from this.  The EPC method might well be a better source.
