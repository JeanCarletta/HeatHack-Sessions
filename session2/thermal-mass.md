# Why isn't air temperature a good indication of thermal comfort in our buildings?

In a modern, well-insulated building that is heated all the time, the air will warm up the building materials so that the air temperature and the surface temperatures will be much the same.  This isn't true for most church buildings.  It takes a great deal of energy to heat all that massive stonework.  Unless they are heated frequently, it remains cooler, making the inhabitants feel less warm than the thermostat setting would suggest.


``` {sidebar} Thermal Mass

Thermal mass is the ability of a material to absorb, store and release heat.  Dense materials like brick and stone have high thermal mass - they can absorb a lot of heat - but they absorb and release it slowly.  

:TODO:  what picture?

Thermal mass can work to a building's advantage.  In places where night is much cooler than daytime, it helps keep a building a steady temperature because the building can heat up the sun during the day and then release it when it is needed.  Big stone buildings are hardest to heat in the morning and easiest in the evening.  Unfortunately, that's the opposite of what most churches want.

:TODO:  argument about frequent heating making the building more comfortable for everyone - but you have to have the uses and the income from uses to match that.

:TODO:  ask Roger about old practices of airing the building on a good dry spring day - something I read was concerned about creating condensation inside the building.
