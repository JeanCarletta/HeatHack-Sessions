# Ventilation to protect health

Covid has made ventilation an even trickier issue than it was before.  Public spaces need good ventilation where people are gathered to avoid spreading it, but the draughts make them uncomfortable - a double whammy.  Some building operators try to cope by whacking up the heating, especially if there are children's groups in - because nurseries and other formal childcare provision are required to send the children home if the space isn't at least 16C.  There simply isn't a good understanding in the community yet about how much ventilation is required and how to provide it in a way that minimises draughts.

If you are a church, please keep in mind that your hierarchy may require compliance with specific guidance they have issued to you. It’s understandable that this guidance will vary – what we know about the science changed rapidly, especially early in the pandemic. So has the level of vulnerability in some (but not all!) of the population.

We don’t have all the answers about this, but we can point to a solid source of information – what the Health and Safety Executive recommends for workplaces:

Assessing the risk of poor ventilation – Ventilation in the workplace (hse.gov.uk)
https://www.hse.gov.uk/ventilation/assessing-the-risk-of-poor-ventilation.htm

Using CO2 monitors – Ventilation in the workplace (hse.gov.uk)
https://www.hse.gov.uk/ventilation/using-co2-monitors.htm

Some community buildings have purchased CO2 monitors so that they can assess how much ventilation they require in their spaces and advise their building users about how to use the building to achieve that. Since it can take multiple monitors for larger spaces, it would make sense to pool together with other local buildings and pass the monitors around. Some buildings have also undertaken remedial work, for instance, to make sure it is easy to open and close windows.

For the more technical, policy-oriented reader, there is also the Royal Academy of Engineering’s assessment of what we should do as a nation for more resilient infection control:

This doesn’t help immediately, but gives some sense of where we might be headed in the future.
