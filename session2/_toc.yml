# The second session showcases engineering approaches to estimation by considering heating requirements and possible
# changes including heat loss mitigations. This requires the group to estimate space volume, the output of heat distribution
# systems and heating appliances, and for heat loss, surface areas by material. It is common for the heating appliances to
# produce far more output than the available distribution can shed, especially in worship spaces. The preparatory materials
# may include simulations and the technical exercise can be worksheet-based. Discussion includes barriers to change and
# how people feel about the effect on the space.
