# Running sessions

Sessions aren't like business meetings.  They are designed to give an equal voice to everyone in the group, encourage the quiet to speak, leading the group to agree on what to do in a way that is likely to be acceptable to the wider community.  That means how they are run is a little different.  

We provide detailed session schedules that are easy to follow while you are running a session.

```{admonition}  Scottish Episcopal Church versions

We are preparing tailored version of these schedules for the Scottish Episcopal Church.  They will be available in mid-September 2023. 

```

You are free to omit individual items and change the session schedules if you think a different order would work better for you as long as you keep within the spirit of the programme.  We are happy to give you advice about tailoring the programme for your circumstances.  For instance, groups who know they will have to keep their current "wet" heating system for at least a year or two and are worried about energy costs might choose to run session 3 as soon as they have enough winter thermal monitoring data.  Spring starts sometimes go ahead and do session 3, but revisit the material when they have better data later on, even after the main programme.  Some groups compress the programme into longer sessions so they can put the site survey into the first session.  

The rest of this section explains more about what happens in sessions and gives tips for running them.  It's for the group leader and engineer to read in preparation.
