# Board Game

We use a "board game" to have the group tell each other the story of what happens in their buildings over the course a week and what the experience is like for their buildings' users.  

The board game has two key outcomes:  

- it helps the group think about the ways users have of making themselves feel warmer or cooler, some of which may waste a great deal of energy or may be ineffective and driving them elsewhere
- it helps them think about the spaces they have that aren't used, why that is, and whether the community needs changes to the building that would bring them into more use

In the game, the group leader moves game pieces around a floorplan of the building to represent people and asks the group three questions:

- Are these people are comfortable?

- What do they do if they're too hot or too cold?

- What would make things better and attract more users?  

At the end, go around the room for each person to suggest one thing they'll take away from the game.  You can allow some discussion and record what they say on a flip-chart or projected document and allow some discussion.

This game is the hardest part of the programme to run.

The challenge for the group leader is to keep the group on track.  Most people aren't used to imagining what the experiences of other people are like.  Groups often try to short-cut the game and assume they know what the outcome will be, and then miss members telling them about space heaters, draughts, open doors, or community needs they know exist.   Be firm at the beginning of the game about telling the story.  Your position of leadership will make them follow.

The challenge for the engineer is being able to read the thermal monitoring data quickly enough to comment on thermal comfort.  This is easiest if they have diary access ahead and the time to look at the data for a typical week, marking up when the users are in.

Group members often fail to be imaginative and ambitious about building changes, sometimes for fear of what others will think.  In our experience communities are less conservative than their individual members think!  The engineer can help the group leader by asking "what if" questions about the unused spaces and reminding the group about heating the air versus heating the people.


```{admonition} Game tips
:class: tip
The floorplan can be simple and sketchy.  This helps the group be playful.  If you bring paper, scissors, and marker pens, you can ask group members to add features and make props as you go along that help you tell the story.

<!-- TODO ask Mary? Mim? to draw a game board? -->

It helps to write the three questions out large where people can see them.
