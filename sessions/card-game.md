# Card Game

We use an action card game to help groups think about change. 

Groups like the tactility of cards and they help encourage everyone to participate.  Although there are many cards, groups tell us that they find their way through them quickly and it makes sense of a hard problem in a short time.  The point of is to get people thinking, not to set a final plan in stone.  One person may offer to take the cards away and come back with "the solution", but that risks missing important insights and doesn't do as much to create support and enthusiasm for change.

For now at least, the card game is on a separate website.  The instructions for how to play it are there.

This page gives tips for the group leader and engineer about how to make it run smoothly.

You will need to discuss how you will run and record the outcome of the game.  In some groups, the engineer takes care of the game action and helps the group triage the cards so they make quick progress while the group leader takes notes.  In others, the group leader runs the games with the engineer just helping to explain the actions, and the group takes the notes.   Whatever you do, the engineer will need to take away what you produce and use something like our template to document the plan, especially if you intend to seek grant funding.

During the game, you need to keep things moving.  There won't be time during the session to discuss possible actions fully, and probably won't even get to every card.  The group will return to the actions later on.  The goal is to see that there are practical actions the group can take and to get a sense of the general shape of what can be done.

The group may have already taken some of the actions on the cards.  The site survey might give enough information to eliminate other cards.  Once the group has an agreed position on whether it's right for them to heat the air or heat the people, this also takes cards out of play. Sometimes the engineer declare special early rounds in the game to remove the cards. This can give groups a feeling of accomplishment and engage them better.  Other engineers pull these cards out ahead of the game and lay them out in marked areas on the table, explaining what they have done.  We leave this to your judgment.  Whatever you do, don't take cards out unless it's clear that the group would all agree.  

If the group is focusing on one type of card - for instance, all cheap actions, or all expensive ones - encourage them to mix it up.  You can either just suggest they look at a different kind of card or declare a special round of the game.  Don't let them remove actions just because they consider them too expensive.  You can remind them that grants change all the time, and use some of the "magic wand" cards to help them think about things they can't imagine achieving by themselves.  Perhaps some actions will be many years in the future, but they still need to know what's right for their circumstances.

Groups that will be running on gas or oil boilers for a while yet need to make sure they consider the many cards that are about heating controls.  Poor control is a major cause of wasted energy in our buildings and sometimes these actions pay back in a cold month or two.  It's possible to get a sense of which actions are useful for a building just from the controls it has and how the building is used, but knowing how fast they'll pay back takes winter data from the thermal monitor.  The board game comes back to look at this.  Meanwhile, if you need to you can plan to look at this later.


You'll need to save some time at the end to discuss what to do about cards where they need more information.  That might be information about the building and its use, about whether the action is suitable, what it might cost and how it might be funded, or what kind of people would need to be involved, including workers and professionals to ensure correct choices are made, oversee  works, or both.  For the definite actions, you could discuss whether it's something to do right now, in a year, in five years, or longer, and perhaps whether it's something you need the rest of the community behind or something you can just do. 

It's hard to know how long to recommend for this discussion, but groups should at least get a flavour of the entire process and talk about how to complete it.

<!-- Our cards and our explanations will not be perfect, especially as in practice we have a wide range of groups and buildings signed up. They will improve over the course of the programme.  You can ask us to improve specific aspects as we go along - some of the volunteer engineers work in the building services industry and will know the answers better than we do, and we can also ask our industry and academic advisers. We expect to blog specific issues as they come up, which will give others the opportunity to comment (either publicly or privately) and to incorporate new material into the explanations as we go along. -->
