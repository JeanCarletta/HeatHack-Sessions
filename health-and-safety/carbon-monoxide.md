## Carbon monoxide safety

Boiler rooms are required to be well-ventilated.  Sometimes community buildings fill the vents to block cold air coming in.  This increases the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.  If the boiler room is not well-ventilated, only enter if the heating has been off for a long time.  If you hear an alarm, it could be a carbon monoxide sounder; leave the area immediately.
