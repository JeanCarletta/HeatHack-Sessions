## Gas safety

Sometimes gas boilers in community buildings aren't very well maintained.  Soot around the appliance, a yellow or orange weak flame instead of a blue one, or a pilot light that blows out easily are all signs that a gas leak is more likely.

If you smell gas: 
- Do not smoke or light matches
- Do not turn electrical switches on or off
- Open all doors and windows
- Turn off the meter at the control handle if possible
- Call the National Gas Emergency number (0800 111 999)

Gas meters are especially dangerous, and for this reason storage in gas meter cupboards or rooms is not allowed. There must be a large air gap between any electrical devices and the meter.  Sometimes technology enthusiasts attach devices to gas meters to take meter readings automatically.  This can be **dangerous**, and your supplier will let you know that they are very unhappy if they find out.  In particular, **never** plug a cable into a gas meter even if you recognise the connector and have a cable with one that fits.  If it ends up applying power to the meter, this could cause an explosion.  

<!-- >:TODO: take advice about size of air gap.  Legislation doesn't say.  I believe working practice is >15cm.

<!-- :TODO: If you really do need automatic readings, sometimes there is sufficient clearance to use timelapse photography on an old digital camera or mobile phone placed some distance from the meter. -->
