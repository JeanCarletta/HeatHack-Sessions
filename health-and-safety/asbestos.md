## Asbestos

Asbestos can be found in any building built or refurbished before the year 2000.  The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 require those with responsibilty for maintenance and repair of community buildings to assess and manage the risks from the presence of asbestos.  They should already have determined the location of materials likely to contain asbestos, probably by commissioning a professional asbestos survey.  They are also required to make and maintain a written record of anything that is, or might be, made of asbestos.

Because you will need to look in some non-public areas of the building, we have already recommended that you ask your building's property manager whether there is any asbestos present on the property and what safety implications that has.

Some forms of asbestos are safe until they are disturbed.  There is, however, a particularly dangerous form of asbestos previously used as insulation where even light disturbance will create fibres that you can breathe in.  This was sometimes used in our buildings, for instance, as lagging and insulation around boilers and pipework.  It can be hard to tell from other forms of insulation.  If you see anything that looks at all like these pictures, even if it is a different colour, do not enter the space until the property manager has confirmed it has been checked by a professional.
