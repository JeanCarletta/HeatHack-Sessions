# Setting ground rules

We have some basic rules that all groups must follow.

- **Always work in pairs.** That way if anything were to happen, someone else would know immediately.

 - **No ladders**.  Yes, we know many of you go up ladders all the time, but many of the ladders in community buildings aren't well maintained.  Also, it's very easy to break light fittings and windows with them.  Ladders aren't necessary for this programme and would slow you down.  When groups are tempted to go up ladders, it's usually to read the ratings on over-door heaters or see how many watts the lightbulbs are, check whether vents are blocked, or measure the height of the space.  There are almost always much safer ways to do these things.  We give tips for some of the more obscure ones, but binoculars, laser pointers, looking through past meeting minutes and bills, and helium balloons all figure.  

 - **No unsafe steps.** Church buildings especially are notorious for steps that are dangerous by modern standards or so worn that they are unsafe.   This rule will usually mean not checking the ventilation arrangements through towers, for instance.

 If you want to hear about a *really* hazardous occupation, talk to someone who repairs Victorian church organs. There's a reason why we have these rules.  You should obey them even if you have a more modern building.  You may need additional rules, depending on the state of the building and possibly also on who is in your group.  You will decide the rules in the first session.
