## Electric meter safety

<!-- taken from a clamp-on meter guide, so been past someone's legal. -->

Although taking electricity meter readings is generally safe, you do need to be careful around them.  If they are badly maintained they could be dangerous to touch.

```{admonition} Safety
:class: important

**WARNING: Touching exposed electrical wires or components may result in electric shock, causing possible death or injury.**


These are all signs that it is unsafe to approach your meter: 

 - corroded cable insulation
 - exposed copper wires 
 - burning odours 

 If unsure, contact a qualified electrician.

- Do not approach your meter with wet hands or clothing.
- Do not approach your meter under the influence of alcohol or any substance which may impair
your judgement.
- If your meter is in a dark area, take a torch.
- Do not allow children to touch meters.

<!-- :TODO: picture of clamp on monitor -->
In some community buildings, it is possible to use clamp-on electricity monitors to view electricity use, and sometimes to save data for later analysis.  This is not possible in buildings with more powerful electricity supplies.  Modern smart meters are often a better option, especially if your supplier will let you view or download historical data.  **Do not fit clamp sensors if the cables are over fifty years old or if you believe they are not double insulated.**
