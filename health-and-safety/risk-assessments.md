# Carrying out a risk assessment

We ask you to carry out a brief risk assessment before starting the first part of the site survey.  There are two steps:  identifying the hazards you will encounter, and agreeing what to do about them.

We have put hazards we have encountered in the past into a simple risk assessment template for you to consider - you need to consider them, but also add any others you can think of. You should also agree how you will reduce or remove the risks.  If you have access to a projector, you can download the template ahead and fill it out where everyone can see.
