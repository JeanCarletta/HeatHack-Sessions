# Energy meter readings

<!--
:TODO: 
- absolutely try to get a smart meter, if it doesn't work check they didn't fob you off with a SMETS1 (they shouldn't); ask CK to write other tips
- take pictures of the meter with a smartphone - this times and dates them automatically
- keep a meter log book (see template) - organists and green users sometimes willing
- use a smartphone app

````{admonition} Will a clamp-on meter work?

 Some community group members will remember the clamp-on electricity monitors that utility companies used to give out that would give readings every six seconds.  **It is sometimes possible to use these meters in community buildings, but getting a smart meter is a much better option.**  Half hourly readings are sufficient for most purposes and smart meters will save historical readings.  It takes specialist computing skills to make these monitors do that just because they have been out of use for so long.

 We can't advise on whether an old clamp-on monitor will work or be safe.  If you intend to use one, please keep in mind that a domestic model might not be suitable for the electricity supply in your building.  You certainly should **not** use clamps if the meter is not well-maintained, if the cables are over 50 years old, if you believe the cables are not double-insulated, if you would need to disturb the cables to have enough room for the clamps, or if they wouldn't fit properly.  You absolutely must not open any electricity supply cabinets or disturb any trunking unless you are a qualified electrician who has been authorised by the community group's trustees to carry out work in the building.

For groups with serious need to monitor the electrics who can't make a smart meter work, another option is to get an electrician to wire a permanent monitor into the supply cabinet.  This is the only possible option for more powerful supplies and costs around Â£400.
