# Energy meter readings

We know that community venues struggle to collect energy meter readings, but without them, consultants can't provide good advice.  Regular meter readings will also help you spot when you start to waste energy accidentally, understand the costs associated with room hires,  and calculate the payback of energy efficiency measures. 

This is why we highly recommend getting **both** gas and electricity smart meters.  

Smart meters send your readings to your utility company every 30 minutes. We expect future energy efficiency consultants to want the full data.   Combining it with heating performance data and historical weather data will let them use "degree days" to understand whether your heating is under good control.
