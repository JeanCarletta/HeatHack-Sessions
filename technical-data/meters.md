# Energy meter readings

We know that community venues struggle to collect energy meter readings, but without them, consultants can't provide as good advice.  Regular meter readings will also help you understand the costs associated with room hires and to spot when you start to waste energy accidentally. This is why we highly recommend getting gas and electricity smart meters.  Smart meters send your readings to your utility company every 30 minutes. 

 Smart meters are free, including the cost of installation, unless the installer identifies unsafe conditions on "your" side of the meter.  That's unlikely, but if they do, you want that fixed!  You can request smart meters from your utility company instead of waiting for them to offer one.   They might refuse you, but they will tell you why.  Usually it's because they know the meter won't be able to communicate with them, your supply is complicated, or your meter is unusual, for instance, in supporting different tariffs for day and night.   You need to have sufficient space around the meter for the installer to make changes, and that can be an issue if you've hidden the meter inside a fancy cabinet.

 ```{admonition} Do smart meters work?

The early "SMETS1" meters always worked as meters, but they often failed to be "smart" and send regular readings to the utility company.  Usually this was because they couldn't cope with changing suppliers and didn't work in high rise flats, but sometimes they couldn't reach the mobile phone network.  The current "SMETS2" meters can change suppliers and use a better network.  Installers can now test the network signal at the meters before they start work so they can spot problems ahead and tell you your options. 

```

If you can't get a smart meter, or face a long wait, here are some of the ways venues get at least some useful information:

1.  by checking past energy bills for **actual** readings, not estimates.  
1.  by checking past energy bills for annual consumption information, which started appearing in 2014.  This might be based on estimates, but taken over several years you can expect the information to be roughly right.
1. for venues where some aspect of energy supply is managed by a larger organisation, such as a "bulk buy" tariff, asking what data that organisation has about your usage.
1. by asking any "green" group in your organisation if they calculate annual carbon footprints, which should have equivalent information.
1. by taking quick photos of the meter readings.  A phone or digital camera will automatically save the time and date with the photo. Someone will then need to go through the photos.

1.  by keeping a notebook and pen next to the meter for writing down the date, time, and reading.  
1.  by taking meter readings in a shared "log" on the web, maybe using our template:

Be inventive about who might be willing to take readings.  If you are church that lets a musician practice sometimes, they might return the favour, or it might be a good task for a teenager.  

Venues with very high energy use might find it worthwhile to get commercial monitoring equipment installed, but that costs several hundred pounds per meter.

Meters can be hard to read properly, especially older ones. It's very important to know whether gas meters are imperial (in ft3) or metric (in m3) and how to transform that into kW. For electricity, there may be separate readings for day rates and night rates.  Without access to past bills, it may not be obvious how many meters there are, whether any are submeters, and what areas they serve.  Even just taking photos of the meters with the current readings will be an achievement for many groups.

````{admonition} Will a clamp-on electric meter work?

 Some community group members will remember the clamp-on electricity monitors that utility companies used to give out that would give readings every six seconds.  **It is sometimes possible to use these meters in community buildings, but getting a smart meter is a much better option.**  Half hourly readings are sufficient for most purposes and smart meters will save historical readings.  It takes specialist computing skills to make these monitors do that just because they have been out of use for so long.

 We can't advise on whether an old clamp-on monitor will work or be safe.  If you intend to use one, please keep in mind that a domestic model might not be suitable for the electricity supply in your building.  We do know some things that for sure aren't safe, though.  You should absolutely **not** use clamps if the meter is badly maintained, if the cables are over 50 years old, if you believe the cables are not double-insulated, if you would need to disturb the cables to have enough room for the clamps, or if they wouldn't fit properly.  You absolutely must not open any electricity supply cabinets or disturb any trunking unless you are a qualified electrician who has been authorised by the community group's trustees to carry out work in the building.
