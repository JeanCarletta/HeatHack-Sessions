# The final small group session looks at the low carbon futures of these buildings. The materials explain potential advances
# in heat loss mitigation, local energy generation options, and energy supply decarbonisation. It will use a game based on
# Carbon Conversations to explore how to plan in the face of uncertainty, stage works, and ensure a good fit to community
# needs. One of the most interesting properties of these buildings results from their mass: they become more comfortable if
# they are heated every day because the walls themselves warm. In a low carbon future, most communities will need to
# choose between greater community use which brings in enough income for maintenance, with the services they provide
# justifying any carbon expenditure, or less frequent/less comfortable use, with eventual deterioration and closure. The
# discussions will explore these issues and plan how to engage others in their community.
