# Session 4 - Making Change

:TEMP: THIS IS THE OLD CONTENT - make sure this is elsehwere in the sessions
:TODO: Figure out what background reading and links are useful to accompany Pam's facilitators guide sketch for session 4 (currently in Teams)

The final small group session looks at the low carbon futures of these buildings. The materials explain potential advances
in heat loss mitigation, local energy generation options, and energy supply decarbonisation. It will use a game based on
Carbon Conversations to explore how to plan in the face of uncertainty, stage works, and ensure a good fit to community
needs. One of the most interesting properties of these buildings results from their mass: they become more comfortable if
they are heated every day because the walls themselves warm. In a low carbon future, most communities will need to
choose between greater community use which brings in enough income for maintenance, with the services they provide
justifying any carbon expenditure, or less frequent/less comfortable use, with eventual deterioration and closure. The
discussions will explore these issues and plan how to engage others in their community.
