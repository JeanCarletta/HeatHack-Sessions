# (DISCUSSION: what worries us about net zero?  gives us hope?)
# "if their hands are too cold to reach into their pockets, they won't put anything in the collection plate"
# "energy bills are going to skyrocket"

# i think we have to start with "Why are churches uncomfortable" - where the heating system
# is (partly) original, designed for lower temperature than modern requirements. 
# cold, draughty, sometimes damp.  (DISCUSSION:  how does this building make 
# you feel)
# What is thermal comfort:  temperature of surrounding surfaces as important as air temperature, RH
# air speed, clothing and activity level important.

# (DISCUSSION:  how have churches and what happens in them changed since you were a child? 
# or can you remember your first impressions of your buildings?  what do you think of them now?  
# you may know their history - how have they changed over the years?)

# different strategies for heating church - localised heating, heat whole building, radiant, underfloor.


# most churches have wet systems
# heat sources - gas boilers, oil, biomass - all usually for wet systems.  Heat water in pipes.
# heat outputs - radiators or pipes in trenches

# radiant panels - don't warm the air, just warm the people.  

# tubular heaters - provide localised heating at the people

# underfloor - provide localised heating and some 

# It's too much to expect them to read through all the types of radiators and so on - we really just want
# a photo gallery for them to understand what they have and they can guess the heat output.  And I think
# maybe this is really part of the exercise where they're assessing how much heat output they have.

# The first session conveys the science behind the engineering by using the principles of heat transfer to explain core
# concepts including convection currents, heat stratification, stack ventilation, and heat loss. It also addresses relative
# humidity and thermal comfort and uses a structured discussion format to explore the groupsâ€™ motivations. Participants
# may variously want to reduce carbon emissions, reduce energy bills, or increase thermal comfort so that the building will
# be used more often. The group will identify their heating system components and building ventilation features. This will
# result in a labelled photo collage or video describing their systems. Finally, the groups will place temperature and relative
# humidity monitoring devices and begin a meter reading log. The log, monitoring traces, and building description together
# form a profile that can be passed to professionals.

# :TODO:  will people expect net zero to get a look in?
