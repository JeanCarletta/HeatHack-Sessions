# Fan convectors

Radiators take a lot of space.  Where space is at a premium, it's possible to use a fan convector instead.  This is just a radiator where a fan is used to move the air, drawing heat away from the radiator faster.  They usually have multiple fan speeds that can be set under the cover.  They can be three or four times as effective as a cast iron radiator for the same space, but they do make some noise when the fan is running.
