# Older heating devices

:TODO: gallery of old equipment with pros and cons:  old radiators causing convection currents, trench heating, tubular heaters (often very hot, don't meet modern H&S) or little radiators under pews (if you turn them up enough to try to warm the entire place rather than people's feet, also an H&S issue).  Include pipework diameter - 4 inch for event heating, 5 inch for constant heating.

Sidebar:  Why are there pipes way up there?  (CCM example, use gravity instead of pump.)

You may have more modern heating apparatuses  in your building, especially your halls  - don't worry, we will be talking about them in session 2!  They work using the same basic principles so you can probably guess their effects.
