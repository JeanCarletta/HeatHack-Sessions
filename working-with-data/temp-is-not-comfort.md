# Temperature is not thermal comfort

The first thing to say is you shouldn't take exact temperature numbers seriously - as you learned in the first session, air temperature is not the same as thermal comfort!  It's best to think of the temperatures on the thermal monitor or the positions on a thermostat as a scale, not an absolute number.  Higher is definitely warmer, at least under similar conditions.

Thermostatic radiator valves are particularly poor judges of room temperature because they are mounted directly on a warm radiator.   This is one reason why they're usually marked 1-6 instead of with temperature values.  

It's a pity we can't take the numbers seriously, because users do.  Many user groups will judge whether they will be comfortable with their eyes as they enter the space by looking at the thermostat and resetting it to whatever temperature they use at home.  Other users will, if they feel cold, whack any thermostat on as high as it will go, in the belief the room will then warm up faster. 

Modern thermostats usually include the ability to specify a temperature correction, or "offset".  An offset of -2C would, for instance, really use 16C when it reads 18C.  This is meant to correct for some kinds of bad thermostat placement, but if you know what the thermostat usually reads when the space attracts the fewest complaints, it can be used to make that correspond to a temperature that users tend to select.

<!-- By the way, some digital thermostats display the current room temperature and some display the temperature at which the thermostat is set.  Users find this very confusing.
