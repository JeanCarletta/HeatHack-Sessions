# Basic observations

When you turn on space heating, the temperature inside the building won't rise steadily.  It rises quickly at first, and then slower and slower.  This is because how hard it is to raise the building by a degree depends on how big the temperature difference is to outdoors.  The bigger the temperature difference, the faster heat gets transferred through the walls, windows, ceilings, and floors - the building envelope - to the outside world.  

This means that when the heating comes on, the temperature trace on the thermal monitor looks like a sawtooth.

:TODO: picture venue 7 jan 14 9:41-19:25, left makes it obviously a saw tooth, right blown up and marked up for where each degree rise and fall intersects the heating curve, or if necessary use an idealised curve

The "teeth" won't look perfect or straight - the monitors are only accurate to within a degree C and there are lots of things that affect what happens, like the external weather (wind and sun as well as temperature), what the building occupants are doing, and how the heating controls work.  

This is a typical trace over a longer period.
