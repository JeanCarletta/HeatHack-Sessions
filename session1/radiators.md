# Radiators

Radiators radiate some heat, but most of the heat transfer is by convection.  The more surface area they have for air to go past, the faster the heat transfer.   Even pipes shed heat into the space and in churches, and sometimes that's an important part of the heating.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

If you block the air movement around a radiator or pipe, that slows down the heat transfer.  Radiators especially need to be kept clear or you won't get the benefit of them, but even the pipes in a space might be designed to intended to shed important amounts of heat.

Here are some common types of radiators.

These just rely on air moving around the radiator.

These are designed to help the air move quickly past the heated fins - they're better at heating the air.

Sometimes churches box radiators and pipes in because they're worried about how warm they get, especially with older people or children about.  That's safer but it makes the heating less efficient and effective.  Low surface temperature radiators are ones that are specially designed to be cooler to the touch, but still work.
