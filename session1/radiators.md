# Radiators and pipes

Radiators radiate some heat, but most of the heat transfer is by convection. 

Radiators radiate heat, warming the surfaces and people around them - but their main purpose is to warm the air by convection.   Cold air moves across the radiator, warms up, and rises, drawing more cold air in its place.   The more surface area they have for air to go past, and the bigger the temperature difference between the radiator and the air, the faster the heat transfer.   

The heat output of a radiator is measured in kW.  To find out what it is, you find the manufacturer's data sheet and look it up by model in a table that assumes a standard difference between the radiator temperature and the air temperature.  It can be hard to find the right model, especially for older radiators, as any markings are hidden, usually on the back.  We'll be estimating the output by looking at the general type and size of the radiator.

Even pipes shed heat into the space.  In systems with old fat pipes, the heat that comes off them can make a very important contribution.  

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

If you block the air movement around a radiator or pipe, that slows down the heat transfer dramatically.  Radiators especially need to be kept clear or you won't get the benefit of them.  Sometimes community buildings block the radiators accidentally because they need the space, but sometimes they box them with joinery in because they are worried about the safety of hot radiators if they serve the very old or the very young.  It's possible to get low surface temperature covers that will improve safety without obstructing the airflow.  :TODO: picture of a radiator with lots of stuff blocking it.

Here are some common types of radiators.

````{panels}
Traditional cast iron

:TODO: Picture of cast iron column radiator 
+++
Cast iron radiators take a long time to heat up, but they also hold heat for a long time.  That makes them much better for spaces that are used for long sessions than for one hour meetings.

Modern panel radiators.

:TODO: picture of a Stelrad radiator
+++
These are designed to help the air move quickly past the heated fins - they're better at heating the air.

:TODO: tubular heaters under pews, not meant to heat the space so much as to heat the people.

:TODO: add a whole other section on electrics - like storage heaters and what's hard about using them for these spaces (the hard part might belong in session 3 under controls)
