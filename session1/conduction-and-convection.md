*Conduction* transfers heat by direct contact. Metal is good at conducting heat.

When a fluid, like water or air, comes into contact with something warm, it warms up, becomes less dense, and rises, drawing cooler fluid behind it.  This transfers heat by *convection*.

Convection is important in churches and community halls because it explains two things that people often find puzzling:  why are radiators often under windows, and why is it so draughty?  

Normally a window lets in some cold air, and is colder than nearby surfaces, so air next to it will sink, causing a cold draught that annoys anyone under the window.  A radiator can counter this natural airflow.

The circular *convection current* shown in the picture only happens when a space has reached its set temperature - the one on the thermostat - and is being maintained at it.  This is called *steady state*.  While a space is still heating up, the airflow is more chaotic and can be colder and pretty strong.  Unfortunately, the way we heat our buildings means that many of them never get to a more comfortable steady state.  This leads to a perverse state of affairs - sometimes a higher thermostat setting can make you **less** comfortable!
