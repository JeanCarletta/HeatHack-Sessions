 # Thermal Comfort

This week is all about two things:  starting to think about what you want to achieve by taking part in the programme, and learning some very basic concepts that can help you understand how heating systems work and why some community buildings are so hard to heat.  

We heat buildings mostly for the people who use them.  That means the most important question for us is "What makes people comfortable?"
