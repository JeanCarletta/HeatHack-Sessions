 # Session One - Why Community Buildings are Hard to Heat

This week is all about two things:  discussing what you want to achieve by taking part in the programme, and learning some very basic concepts that can help you understand how heating systems work and why some community buildings are so hard to heat.  

In this week's exercise, you'll be taking pictures or videos of your heating system and the parts of your building where most of the heat gets lost, as part of a profile you will be building up that describes your buildings and your aspirations for it.  Every week, you'll add something new to this profile, and at the end, you should find it useful for discussions with your local community and with the professionals who serve you.  

But first, we need to introduce a little bit of science.  We heat buildings for the people who use them.  That means the most important question for us is "What makes people comfortable?"

```{admonition} Sign Post
Sometimes the owners of lightly occupied buildings turn the heating on, not to make them comfortable for people, but because they want to keep the building safe.  We address this in session 2.
