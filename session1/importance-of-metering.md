# What use are meter readings?

Energy consumption is useful to get under lots of circumstances.  In summer, places with multi-boiler installations have often been told "leave them on all the time",  but there can be a lot of hot water circulating around the boiler room just in case the temperature drops below setpoint. Special weeks when some spaces are empty are great for estimating energy costs associated with different kinds of room use, an important part of setting costs for room hires.  In the past we've had to resort to meter log books and timelapse photography but the lucky groups will have smart meters with companies that will give them access to the data.  We don't know how common this is yet.

```{sidebar} Degree Day Measurement

The standard approach to understanding whether heating systems are under proper control is "degree day measurement".  It compares the energy consumption over different regular periods (usually a week) but taking into account the weather.  This approach makes it possible to establish what energy consumption one would expect for a week and notice when something wasteful is going on.  

:TODO: provide a slightly more technical summary of what you can get from this approach - 

Degree day measurement is very difficult to do in most community buildings for three reasons:

- they usually don't have access to regular meter readings.
- building use is too irregular - if the building is heated for different amounts of time in different weeks, it's too hard to make a comparison.
- good measurement relies on choosing the right base temperatures for the building - the externai temperatures at which the building will need to be heated or cooled - and these are often different than for the kinds of buildings where degree day measurement is common.
