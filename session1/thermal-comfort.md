# What makes people comfortable?

When people feel cold, they'll do whatever is most obvious that might make them them feel better.  Usually that means turning up the thermostat. In most buildings, thermostats are good at showing how comfortable a space is.  They work much less well in our spaces.  This is because how people feel depends on much more than the temperature of the air.
