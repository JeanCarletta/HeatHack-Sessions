## Surrounding surfaces 

The temperature of the surrounding surfaces is just as important as the air temperature for how people feel.  To understand why, we need a very basic scientific concept:  *heat transfer*. One of the ways that heat can transfer from a warm object to a cooler one is by *radiation*, or electromagnetic wave.

The sun is very hot, and heat transfers from it to the surfaces around it, no matter how far away they are.

The person is warmer than the surrounding surfaces, so heat transfers from the person to the building.

We're all familiar with what heat radiating from the sun feels like, but we're less aware that when we're surrounded by cooler surfaces, heat is radiating from us to them.  

The average temperature of surrounding surfaces is called the *mean radiant temperature*.  In comfort assessments, it is just as important as the air temperature.    Cold surfaces, like windows or stone walls that haven't had a chance to warm up, can be very noticeable.

  ````{panels}
   Mean radiant temperature is measured by putting a temperature sensor inside a matte black globe because that absorbs radiation instead of reflecting it.  Sometimes people make  them from copper toilet floats or ping pong balls. That's practical engineering -  cost-effective and based on science!
