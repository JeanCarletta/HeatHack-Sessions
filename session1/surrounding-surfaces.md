## Surrounding surfaces 

The temperature of the surrounding surfaces is just as important as the air temperature for how people feel.  To understand why, we need a very basic scientific concept:  *heat transfer*. One of the ways that heat can transfer from a warm object to a cooler one is by *radiation*, or electromagnetic wave.

The sun is very hot.  Heat transfers from it to cooler surfaces no matter how far away they are. Because the sun is very hot, this radiation is very noticeable!

People are usually warmer than the surrounding surfaces, so heat transfers from the person to the building. The colder the walls, windows, ceiling, and floor, the more heat the person loses.

We're all familiar with what heat radiating from the sun feels like, but most of the time we're less aware that when we're surrounded by cooler surfaces, heat is radiating from us to them.  

The average temperature of surrounding surfaces is called the *mean radiant temperature*.  In comfort assessments, it is just as important as the air temperature.    Very cold surfaces, like single-glazed windows in winter, can be very noticeable.

Mean radiant temperature is measured by putting a temperature sensor inside a matte black globe because that absorbs radiation instead of reflecting it and then checking how the sensor reads when the surface temperatures are known.  Black globe thermometers are very specialised and expensive as a result.  When engineers build their own, they usually use a ping pong ball or copper toilet float painted black.
