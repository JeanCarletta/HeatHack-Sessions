# The physics of heating

<!-->
There are two main strategies that can be used to heat a space.  The first is **space heating*** - bringing an entire space to a stable temperature.  This is the approach most of us are used to from our homes.  The second is **localised heating**  - just applying heating to a localised area in a bigger space to make the people there 

Nope, this isn't the right way in, infrared panels etc

It's useful to think about what the building was designed to do, especially if you still have elements of the original (or at least early) heating system in place.  So, how would we know?  Looking at your older equipment will give you some clues.  But first we have to introduce the two remaining methods of heat transfer: *conduction* and *convection*.  (The first one was *radiation*, the method behind why the temperature of the surfaces around you matter.)
