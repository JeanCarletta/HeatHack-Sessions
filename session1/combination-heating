## Heating Combinations

Sometimes it can make good sense to combine different kinds of heating or have mixed strategies.  Trench heating often tries to warm the whole space but at least drifts warm air past people as it does so.  
Could have a background level of heat only, giving up on the decreasing gains you get from space heating, and top up with pew cushions or radiant panels.  This will become important in the future
more modern heat sources like heat pumps give a lower water temperature than gas/oil, but are designed to run all the time, and are likely to change the way we think about heating.  We will return to this in session 4.
