:TODO: throughout, two types of further reading - technical for the interested engineers, and less technical for the non-engineers.  Make sure it's clear which things are highly technical!  I can see some of these engineers are interested to dip their toes in a new area so we want to show them how EPCs are done on these buildings, that degree days exist but don't work for heating schedules that change a lot and are hard without smart meters, and so on.  We need to figure out where this stuff goes - it could be that there's an extra guide just for the engineers, but it's kind of nice to show it here, I think.
