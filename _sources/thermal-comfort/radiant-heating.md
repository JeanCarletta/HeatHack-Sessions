# Radiant heating

Radiant or "infrared" heating mostly heats the people by making the surfaces that surround them warmer.   It might not look like you expect.  It doesn't all glow.  Most panels are mounted high up for safety and to give them wide angle coverage of the space that keeps the warmth from being blocked by furniture.  You are most likely to spot radiant heating in hospitals, where it is popular because it doesn't circulate dust.  In modern, smaller spaces, flat white ceiling panels are the most common form and they can be hard to spot. Radiant heating can also come as chandeliers or integrated with the lighting.

Few community venues currently have radiant panels.  Many are interested in them because the running costs are much lower than for space heating and they are instant-on, so no one has to program the heating.  They  hold back because it's hard to get good advice about installing them.   Here is ours.

You’ll need professional help to assess what type is best for your application and calculate heating requirements for the space so you don’t install more heating than you need - users aren’t good at turning things off or down.  However, unlikely with space heating, reputable manufacturers are geared up to provide this design service for you  You can trust them to get it right.  They will make sure you get the right wavelength for the size of your space.  They will also determine the right angles and locations for heaters to give even coverage throughout the space.  Frenger, Solray, and Consort Claudgen are all reputable manufacturers, but there are probably others. The Consort Claudgen “Twinzone” is unusual in being able to deliver narrow beam or wide beam heating, depending on how it is assembled. Any decent manufacturer will give you full technical specifications for what they sell. If, like many of the no-brand options, they don’t, you’ll want to steer well clear. 

The manufacturers won’t install the panels for you. With gas boilers, the installer’s skills make a real difference to performance, efficiency, and longevity. With radiant panels, they don’t. Any competent electrical contractor should be able to install the equipment to a specified design but the manufacturers sometimes also have installers they recommend.  


Make sure you think about how power will be supplied to the panels.  You might not have enough power available in the right places to run them, but changing this can be very expensive, especially if you need a completely new supply to the building.  Some models of panel require a three phase supply and you might not have one.  Also, in heritage buildings, you’ll want to think about how the panels can be mounted.

Also, be careful about the potential effects of the heating on any delicate objects in the space like paintings and musical instruments.
