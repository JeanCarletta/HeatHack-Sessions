## Other factors

There are other factors besides air temperature and mean radiant temperature that affect thermal comfort.  Some of them can be extremely important in community buildings.  They are:

- **Draughts.** Even a warm draught will feel cold.  People vary tremendously in how much draughts degrade their comfort, but on average women are more affected than men.  

- **Relative humidity.** This is the amount of moisture the air has compared to the total amount of moisture it can hold, which varies with the temperature of the air.  The warmer the air is, the more moisture it can cold.  Relative humidity has a range from 0-100%.  When it reaches 100%, moisture falls out of the air.  Too wet or too dry are both uncomfortable, but it's still something of an open question what range is acceptable under what conditions.  In our buildings, wThere are also other reasons to think about thermal comfort besides thermal comfort, like the health of the building, its furnishings, and its occupants.  

- **How active the occupants are.**  This is usually described as *metabolic rate*.  If people are running around, they will be comfortable at lower temperatures.  

- **Clothing levels.** Up to a point, more layers of clothing and materials like wool that trap air will also make people comfortable at a lower temperature.  People are very adaptable to different circumstances, as long as the circumstances don't change too fast! It's a pain and socially awkward to have to keep taking clothes on and off.  One of the most important things you can do to make people comfortable is ensure consistent conditions so they know how much clothing to bring and don't have to keep changing it while they are in the venue.  One part of this is making sure your thermostat is the more accurate, digital type and in a good location that accurately reflects the room's air temperature.  

Comfort isn't always straightforward to assess.  For instance, if people walk to a venue and then are inactive the entire time they are there, they will think the space is cooling when in reality the temperature is holding steady.  However, keeping in mind the full set of factors will help you think about what users experience.

A scientific instrument to measure thermal comfort needs sensors for all aspects of thermal comfort - air and relative humidity sensors, a black globe to measure mean radiant temperature, and an omni-directional anemometer to measure draughts.  These do exist, but they are very expensive.  The main market is for the military to assess thermal stress on its personnel.  Heating systems rely solely on air temperature sensors when they judge whether a space is too warm or too cold.  That works well in modern, well-insulated and draught-proofed buildings that are constructed of materials that warm quickly, but not so well in older community buildings, especially if they are not in very frequent use.   People naturally judge comfort by looking at the number on a thermostat, but it's better in these buildings simply to think of it as a range from low to high.
