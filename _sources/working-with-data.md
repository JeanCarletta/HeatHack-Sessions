# What to look for in monitoring data

It won't be obvious at first sight, but it's possible to tell a fair bit about the heating system and whether it is serving the building and its users well just based on the temperature and relative humidity data from the monitors we supply.  Here are some of the things to look for.

```{admonition} Hint

The plots in this section are just images so you can't use the controls to change what you see.  To try these techniques, use the data book.

```

```{admonition} Work in progress
In the week of 27 Feb, we will add:


- judging user experience
- knowing when to turn the heating on and off, and whether optimised start control would save energy
- knowing whether there are enough radiators/heating appliances or a circulation problem
- spotting portable heating
- spotting open windows and doors
- thinking about relative humidity

```
<!-- - in circulation mention variable speed pumps? -->
