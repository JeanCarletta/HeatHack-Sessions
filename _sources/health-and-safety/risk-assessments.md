Your engineer will lead you through a brief risk assessment before you carry out the first activity that might take you into non-public areas - the site survey.  During a risk assessment, you identify the hazards you may encounter and agree what to do about them to reduce the risks they present. We have put some common hazards into a simple risk assessment template based on one from the Health and Safety Executive.  You need to consider them, but also add any others you can think of.
