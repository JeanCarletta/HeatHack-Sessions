# Timeswitches and countdown timers


You should think about how to keep any power-hungry electrical appliances, like electric urns and heaters, from being left on. It is very common in community buildings to find them on overnight.

You can stop this from happening by putting it the appliance on a countdown timer, for instance, so that when people push the button, it runs for one hour.

If you need the appliance to operate before anyone comes into the building you can instead use a timeswitch to control it and make sure it gets turned off.  There are cheap timers available even for plug-in appliances, but think carefully about whether it lets users leave the appliance on accidentally.  Any "override" should if possible be time limited.  If you can't find a suitable timer and have a small number of well-trained users, signage might work to remind them to switch it off.  


If you need to buy new electrical equipment, look for models that have the control features you need built in.
