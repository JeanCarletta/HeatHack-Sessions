# Heating controls for "wet" systems

A poor choice of heating controls can waste a substantial amounts of energy - often enough to get a quick payback on investment in new controls.   Unfortunately, installers and even architects often fail to think about how the building is used and make poor choices as a result.  Controls designed for houses assume that the residents can come to some  kind of grudging agreement about the settings.  Controls designed for industrial buildings are more expensive and typically only allow temperature variation in a small range and assume the building occupants don't need to have much individual control.  Community buildings don't fit either case cleanly and so we often have to compromise on what we can get.

This section isn't as good as we would like yet, but we offer individual meetings with engineers and groups when they need help.  Choosing controls is genuinely very difficult and we particularly expect to discuss this where it is needed.
