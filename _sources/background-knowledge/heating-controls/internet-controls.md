# Internet controls

It used to be difficult to find controls that had the right features for community buildings.  This is becoming easier with the introduction of internet controls that can communicate with each other using radios or over a wifi network and that you set using a phone app or website.  

```{admonition} "Smart controls"
:class: tip

Some sources use "smart" to mean controls with energy efficiency features:  optimisation, weather compensation, and/or load compensation.  Others use "smart" to mean internet controls.
```

Internet controls:

- incorporate modern energy efficiency features like optimised start control and weather compensation. 
- allow building users to make temporary thermostat changes within limits you set.  For rooms with multiple thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs), you can set them up so that adjusting one adjusts them all.
- allow you to program the heating timings for individual rooms even if your heating isn't zoned

They also have some disadvantages:

- They require building wifi, a major expense if you don't already have it.
- It might take some experimentation to get all the components to communicate with each other, especially in stone buildings.
- Only the more expensive versions are fully programmable using a device on the wall.
- If you have many radiators in rooms you want to control individually, the costs soon mount up.
- Not many of our heating suppliers have experience installing and configuring them.
- They use batteries that you will have to remember to change or your devices will stop working.  That probably means replacing them all at once when you think they are about to fail, so that you still serve your users well.

Just like with other heating controls, it's necessary to check all the details on the system you have in mind, and sometimes to ask questions of the manufacturer.  

- Not all internet controls make use of the ability of modern boilers to modulate their output.  This could lose the energy efficiency advantage of a newer boiler.
- With some internet controls, changes to the heating can only be done using a phone app or website.  That might mean registering the leaders of every group that uses your building.
- Some heavily advertise that they will learn your heating schedule - not a useful feature in community buildings - but we think they all will let you set a heating schedule instead.


```{admonition} Radio and wireless range
"Internet controls communicate with you and with each other using radio frequencies.   If there are stone walls or lots of obstacles between two devices that need to communicate by radio, the signal might not be strong enough for the system to work.  If your building is like this, you may be better off with lower radio frequencies, since they pass through stone more readily.  The radio frequencies in use for internet heating controls are 433 MHz, 868 MHz, and 2.4 GHz.  433 MHz is the lowest.  Wireless internet is 2.4 GHz and this is always what the main component uses to try to reach your wireless router.  The trick is to get the main component close enough to the TRVs that need controlled for it to reach, but also close enough to your router.  You can check the wireless internet (wifi) signal strength in different parts of your building using your phone.  There are two ways to get signal to an area that doesn't have it.  If the router and the new area are on the same phase of electricity, you can used an internet over powerline extender.  Otherwise, you need a more powerful router or a wireless repeater between the two locations.
