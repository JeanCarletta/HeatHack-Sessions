# Zoning

Zoning is another way of making heating more efficient.  With zoning, a motorised valve controls the flow of hot water to radiator circuits that can be individually controlled with different 
time programmes.  You can either do this using a different timeswitch or programmer for each zone, or using one that has multiple "channels" for multiple zones.

It is common for community buildings to have to heat two large rooms whenever either is in use, or a large room whenever a set of small rooms is in use.  Zoning can greatly reduce energy use if this is the case for you. 

Zoning isn't always expensive or disruptive.  If you find it will be for your building:

- You can consider internet controls instead.  With internet controls, hot water will still flow around all of the pipework in your building whenever the boiler is on, but you would at least be able to program the timings for the radiators room by room.

- There are a few TRVs on the market that have a small battery-operated programmer on them that can be used to bring the radiator on using an independent heating schedule.  They are a pain to program because the controls are so small and down near the floor, but they can be useful in rooms that have very regular heating schedules.

- You can also consider independent electric heating to replace use of the main heating in some rooms at times when the larger space is empty.  If you have a large boiler that can only be on or off, not use a range of heating outputs, it may not make sense, or even be possible to run it, just to heat a couple of small rooms.  Independent electric heating can be a good strategy for frequently occupied offices.  If no one is sure when the office will be occupied, radiant heating can be a good solution because it is very quick to make people comfortable.
