# Energy Efficiency for Community Buildings

This section of the guide reinforces the programme concepts and provides practical support for taking the actions in the card game or interpreting the thermal monitoring traces for session 3.  

As far as we are able, we write materials "on demand" in response to group questions and also work to connect groups with external services and people who can offer more expert advice.  Our eventual goal is to make it so that our materials are useful even to groups that run the programme with no interaction with us, but meanwhile, please contact us if you need something you can't see here.
