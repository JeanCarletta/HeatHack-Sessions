- **From a hot water tank or "cylinder" fed by your heating system.**

It's most efficient to heat just as much water as your users need, just before they need it.

You should check that there is a cylinder thermostat.  Usually these are strapped to the cylinder.  If you can't find one, look on the floor as they do fall off.  They lose accuracy over the years, which might make the water hotter than you intend.
