# Other common problems with wet systems

Here are some other commonly found problems you could look for or ask your supplier about.

- **Air in the system.** If a radiator is cold at the top and warm at the bottom, then the problem is air in it.  You can fix this yourself by bleeding the radiator when the system is cold. Don't do it when the system is running as this can damage the boiler.  Old fat pipe systems could have bleed valves on the pipes.  If you don't bleed them, you might stop getting heat to an entire set of radiators.

- **Sludge in the system.** If a radiator or pipe is cold at the bottom and warmer higher up, there's sludge in the way slowing the water down. If this is the problem, the solution might be a power flush and a magnetic filter.  Sludge can also block filters in the system.  In this case, the pipe will be different temperatures either side of the filter.

- **Valves broken or set incorrectly.**  Valves control the flow of water through pipes and into radiators.  They might be set permanently, controlled by a motor, or operated manually by means of a lever or dial.  Motorised valves get stuck sometimes.  Levers can get knocked closed or moved by building users especially if they are at the back of a cupboard in a public area.  Thermostatic radiator valves  - the ones on radiators that users can use to change the room temperature - break easily and often get wrenched all the way off by people who are too hot.  Valves that require tools to reset are less likely to go wrong, but it's not unknown to find them closed when they should be open or open when they should be closed.  You may be able to tell - look for pipes and radiators that are completely cold or cooler than you would expect and then look for valves between them and the boiler.


- **Boiler that won't hold pressure.** A well-maintained boiler shouldn't need repressurising between annual services. You shouldn't let building users repressurise the boiler themselves because if they do it while the system is running they could damage it.   If your boiler loses pressure frequently, you don't necessarily need a new boiler.  There is a second, hidden place for repressurising the boiler that workers sometimes forget to check. You may just need a new pressure relief valve - although these can be annoying expensive if they only come as part of a larger assembly of parts - or a new expansion vessel, which could be housed outside the boiler and bypass the faulty one built-in.  Your supplier should diagnose what the actual problem is and help you make a judgment about the most worthwhile course of action.    

- **Wrong pump size or setting.** It can be a problem if pumps are too small or too large.  In older community buildings, too small is more common.  Most recent pumps are variable speed so this can be corrected to some degree, but installers rarely do the work to check which speed is best.  If it takes a very long time from when you turn the system on until the "return" pipe at the boiler starts to get warm, this could be the problem, but how long to expect depends on many things.


- **Botched multi-boiler installation.** In the 1990s, suppliers started replacing large boilers with multiple smaller ones.  Especially in the early years, they often got the pipework diameter and arrangement of valves and pumps wrong.  This can be expensive to fix.
