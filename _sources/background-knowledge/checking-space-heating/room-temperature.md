# What's a good room temperature?

Before you can know whether your current space heating system is operating correctly, you need to decide what temperature you're aiming for.

What makes for an acceptable room temperature has crept up over the years.  Between 1980 and 2013, it was illegal in the UK to heat public spaces to above 19C unless there was good reason, like that they were used by the very young or older adults.  The law was created in response to worries about the UK's energy supply.  The law was much ignored and only ever used by employers to respond to workers who asked them to turn the heating up.  The restriction was removed when the crisis was over as part of a drive to remove "red tape".

Most thermostats go to 26C, and if you have thermostats that the public can reach, you are likely to find them set that way.  The Health and Safety Executive recommends never heating above 24C because this can be dangerous for people with heart conditions. The World Health Organisation and UK policy experts would like to see 18C become the norm for heating as thatâ€™s perfect for general health, but a big step down from what many Westerners are now used to. The most believable of the possible UK climate policy models requires average room temperature to be set to 16C.   

**Your organisation should have a policy in place setting target temperatures and have the technical or social controls to enforce the policy.**  Keep in mind that the standards assume space heating.  If you are heating the people, you don't need a target room temperature, and if you are mixing the two approaches, your target temperature can be lower.
