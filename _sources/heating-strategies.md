# Heating Strategies

:TODO: - sketch:

- Most common strategy is space heating - trying to get the entire building air and envelope warm.  Heating usually relies on convection (show convection cell) - typically gas boiler and finned radiators, which actually transfer heat by convection much more than they radiate.

- Another strategy is localised heating - just getting the heat to the people.  This could be radiant heating (heat transfer by radiation) or things like heated pew cushions (heat transfer by conduction).

- obviously the picture is really mixed; modern radiators radiate a bit, column radiators teh radiation is actually useful, they're good for long term low heating; underfloor heating both conducts (to your feet) and convects and radiates.  But there's still a basic choice to make, heat the space or just heat the people.  The higher the occupancy and the less heat lossy the building, the more space heating might make sense (it undeniably is nicer...).  With low occupancy and high heat loss, space heating is problematic.
