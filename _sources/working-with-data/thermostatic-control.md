# Thermostatic control

When a thermostat is working well, it flattens either the peaks of the curves - by turning the heating off when a space is warm enough and then back on again if the space temperature drops too far.  This can be difficult to observe in buildings that are only occupied for an hour at a time, but if the heating is left on for a long time, it should look like this:

:TODO: plot showing 2C cycling around a setpoint

The depth of the rise and fall is important, because people feel uncomfortable if it varies by more than around 2C.   In response, they demand higher temperatures that won't necessarily make them more comfortable, especially if that introduces draughts.  Old analogue thermostats often enforce a wider range than this.  Digital thermostats should be accurate to within 1C, making the space more comfortable.

:TODO: new draughts could be because they turn up the stat themselves throwing the building out of steady state, or just because of increased temperature difference, is this useful enough to mention?  Probably not.

Another kind of thermostat, a setback thermostat, is very similar, but instead of flattening the peaks, it flattens the troughs, to enforce a minimum temperature on the space.  That looks like this:

:TODO, from venue 1 in December

Sometimes the same thermostat on the wall operates as both a room thermostat and a setback thermostat, and sometimes there are two separate thermostats.  Buildings with older heating controls may not have a setback thermostat.

As always, what you see will not always cleanly match this pattern.  The thermal monitor is likely to be in a different location than the thermostat.  Wired thermostats especially are placed where they are easy to wire and are often in corners where the air doesn't move, mounted on cold external walls, or above radiators.  Thermostatic radiator valves are particularly poor judges of room temperature because they are mounted directly on a warm radiator. The thermal monitor location will likely yield data that is more representative of user experience.  

:TODO: somewhere - not here - need to explain about room stats having master control of the boiler/can't get heat from TRVs in side rooms because the hot water isn't being supplied?

It's a pity modern thermostats display the temperature, because many users think with their eyes.  If the display shows a temperature lower than what they think of as normal for their home, they will automatically turn it up, whether they are cold or not - and usually they will just push it as far as it will go, thinking that will heat the space faster.  Although for a well-placed thermostat the same number will always reflect whether the majority of occupants are comfortable, that number doesn't really translate across different spaces.  The ideal end user control (which doesn't exist!) would simply have two buttons for "up a bit" and "down a bit" that reset when they leave, without any other markings.
