# Checking thermostatic control

If the room reaches the temperature set on a thermostat, that cuts the top of the wave off.  A good thermostat will hold the temperature within a degree of the temperature that is set on it.  

In many community buildings, even if there are thermostats, they may not be working.  It's common to find wired thermostats are no longer attached to the heating system.  Occasionally these are decoys left on purpose to give users the illusion of control, but usually they're just broken or from a previous system.  It's also common to find wireless thermostats where the batteries are flat or the radio doesn't reach the boiler because it has been moved.

It takes time to check these things, so we usually look at the temperature data first for evidence either way.  Even if technically the thermostat is working, it may not be effective.   Wired thermostats especially are placed where they are easy to wire and are often in corners where the air doesn't move, mounted on cold external walls, or above radiators.  Thermostatic radiator valves are particularly poor judges of room temperature because they are mounted directly on a warm radiator. The thermal monitor location will likely yield data that is more representative of user experience.

There are three questions to answer about any thermostat in the room where the monitor is:

- **Is it working?**

:TODO: pairs of plot showing 2C cycling around a setpoint and a setback

If you can see any sudden plateaus that cut off the peak or trough of a heating curve and hold roughly the same temperature for some time, that's reasonable evidence that it is.  In spaces that are only occupied for an hour at a time it's easier to look for a cut-off trough, but that only works if the system is a relatively modern one that uses the thermostat to enforce a "setback" minimum temperature at all times.

- **Is it accurate enough to keep people comfortable?**

People will be uncomfortable if the held temperature varies by more than 2C and then demand a higher room temperature as a result, even though that won't necessarily help.  If it's an old analogue thermostat, you can assume it's not that accurate.  For a digital thermostat, looking at the trace will suggest whether it is.  If it isn't, the problem could be something about the thermostat but it could also just be in a location that isn't representative enough of what users feel.

- **If it displays a temperature, does that match the monitor?**

Many digital thermostats allow you to choose an "offset" value to be substracted or added to its reading before display - so, for instance, if it thinks it's 20C but you know it reads high, you can make it display 19C.   Because building users tend to judge their comfort from what it says, this can be a very useful option.  

There are also a few systems that, instead of displaying what temperature the room is, display what temperature the system is aiming to have the room at.  Some users find this very confusing.  



:TODO: new draughts could be because they turn up the stat themselves throwing the building out of steady state, or just because of increased temperature difference, is this useful enough to mention?  Probably not.



:TODO: somewhere - not here - need to explain about room stats having master control of the boiler/can't get heat from TRVs in side rooms because the hot water isn't being supplied?
