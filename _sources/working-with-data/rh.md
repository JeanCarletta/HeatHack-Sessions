# Thinking about relative humidity

:TODO:

- over 80% risks rot
- need to avoid condensation on the walls and dew point (rain indoors)
- generally 45-65% considered comfortable for people but pretty tolerant if they're not in there a long time -  but we need to check with building services engineers because we see varying advice
- dry is bad for some kinds of furnishing and for old people if they're going to be in the space a lot (causes skin problems for them)
