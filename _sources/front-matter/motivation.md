# Is this for us?
 
 Many community buildings are churches and ex-church buildings, and we will have extra things to say about them, because they are particularly difficult buildings to get right.  However, you don't need to have one of these buildings to take part.  The programme is intended for any community group with a building over 10 years old where they suspect energy is being wasted, especially from heating, a building's largest energy use.

```{note} 

This programme is not the place to debate whether climate change exists or whether human behaviour has the power to affect its course for good or ill.  

It is also not the place to discuss climate change and its effects on the planet, although if that is your main interest, you may wish to consider two other programmes from The Surefoot Effect, Climate Conversations and Conversations for Change.
