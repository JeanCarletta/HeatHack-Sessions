# About this programme

This programme has been developed based on experiences within HeatHack, a group of community volunteers and students in Edinburgh that have been helping churches and a few other community groups understand how to heat their buildings better.  HeatHack has previously been funded by the John Templeton Foundation via Scientists in Congregations Scotland, with small contributions from the University of Edinburgh Schools of Informatics and Engineering and the University of St Andrews School of Computer Science.  

It has been developed and is being run in conjunction with The Surefoot Effect, a Community Interest Company.  Surefoot has created and run many successful programmes that help communities, businesses and governments put sustainability and resilience at the heart of what they do.  We have support from Engineers without Borders UK to help find engineers for community groups who cannot find them for themselves.

Since 2012, Surefoot has been helping communities, businesses and governments put carbon reduction and care for the environment at the heart of strategy.  We work at every level, locally, nationally and internationally to support the essential paradigm shift needed to protect people and the planet. Our continued success lies in the values-based, people and process-led approaches we use and tailor to each project.

Engineers Without Borders UK is working to reach the tipping point to ensure a safe and just future for all. Part of a global movement of over 60 Engineers Without Borders organisations, we inspire, upskill and drive change in the engineering community and together take action to put global responsibility at the heart of engineering.

The programme would not be possible without the generous support of the Royal Academy of Engineering through their Ingenious public engagement programme.
