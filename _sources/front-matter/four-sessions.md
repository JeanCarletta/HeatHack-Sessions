# The Sessions

Each session has a different focus.

- **Session 1** introduces some core concepts that affect the big decisions building operators need to make - "thermal comfort" or what makes people comfortable, is a big part of this, as is thinking about the right strategy for heating and preserving your building. The session also makes a start at collecting technical data for the building by deciding on a strategy for collecting temperature and relative humidity data as well as energy meter readings. In addition, there are some activities to help ease group members into thinking about this topic and what, for some groups, could lead to major changes to the building and how it used. Like all sessions, it ends by identifying what actions need to be taken next to move things forward.

- In **Session 2**, the group starts thinking about what actions are appropriate to include in a future plan for their buildings.  The session includes a site survey that serves to familiarise the group with aspects of the building they may never have considered and helps the group document what is known and unknown about its heating, insulation, and other features that affect energy use.  The session also includes a "card game" of possible future actions that is used to quickly sketch out the basis of a future plan.

- For most groups, it may take some time to make major changes, and it's worth thinking about whether minor changes to the current heating would curb energy wastes. Most energy efficiency programmes fail to look at this, but in our experience, it's common for the heating in community buildings to be misconfigured or have poor controls that are very wasteful.  **Session 3** uses the temperature monitoring data to find obvious wastes as well as help the group think about whether their users are likely to be comfortable and what they do when they are not - which often involves more waste.  In session 3, the group also thinks about the flow of users through the building over the course of a week, whether the community needs their empty spaces, and what modifications might be needed to meet these needs.

- **Session 4** brings the planning together, looking again at the possible future actions and how to approach achieving the ones the group has chosen.  Session 4 also gives time to plan how to engage with the local community, usually with a community engagement event.  The event will help groups finalise their thinking, get the community behind their plans, and demonstrate to funders that the plan is right for them.
