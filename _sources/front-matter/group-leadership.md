# Choosing a group leader

The engineer's role in the group is to guide you through the decisions that you need to make, looking after the technical side of the programme.  One member of your group will need to act as the group's leader, looking after the "people" side.  This means:

- scheduling the group sessions, making sure there is a space available and working out how the group can access the busy buildings for activities like the site survey
- arranging access to any documentation for the building
- running some of the session activities, looking after the group dynamics, and keeping track of the time
- liaising with building's owners or management about what happens as a result of the programme
