# Common Heating Controls



A wet heating system is just a big water heater and pump that circulates hot water around some pipework feeding the radiators.  Sometimes all the radiators are on the same set of pipework - the heating system has a single **zone** - and sometimes there are several independent zones.  


The building regulations only ever require that heating controls be updated when a new boiler is put in, so what controls you have is likely to depend on the age on the boiler they are controlling.  

<!-- :TODO: get the dates, search on 20XX-->

For the oldest systems, before 20XX, the system probably has a radiator uncontrolled somewhere as a safety bypass on each zone for the boiler to dump any extra heat.  Other radiators might also be uncontrolled or could have **thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs)** so the room stays at a specific temperature.  There is usually a **timeswitch** for setting the on and off times of each zone independently.  When the timeswitch calls for heat in a zone, the system opens a motorised valve to allow hot water circulates around the zone's pipes, and this hot water flows through the radiators, unless the TRV shuts that radiator off.

For systems since 20XX, instead of just the timeswitch controlling whether hot water will circulate, one room will probably have a **room thermostat**.  If the master room is warm enough, then it doesn't matter how cold the other rooms are - they won't get heat.  In practice, room thermostats usually end up in draughty hallways and set fairly high to guarantee they'll never operate.  Every radiator outside the room with the room thermostat is likely to have a TRV, although if the boiler is old enough to still not have an internal bypass, there will still be at least one uncontrolled.  No room should have a room thermostat **and** TRVs.

Sometimes the timeswitch and room thermostat are in two different boxes on the wall, very possibly in different rooms.  Sometimes they are combined into an all-in-one **programmable room thermostat**.  


Most houses and many community buildings have heating control systems where the thermostat in a room can call for heat and still not get any because of what is happening in another room. This can cause confusion and wasted heat.  We explain how common heating controls work and some of the issues they cause in community buildings, and then describe the ideal situation and newer controls on the market that might help.
