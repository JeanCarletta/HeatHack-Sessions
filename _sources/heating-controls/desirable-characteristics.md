# Desirable properties for controls in community buildings

The building regulations specify control in terms of function, not format.  As long as a control system can achieve the properties and energy savings required in the regulations, they are allowed - otherwise the regulations would stifle the innovations we so badly need for improvement. 

Our ideal end user control would have two buttons on the wall of every room controlling just that room.  The buttons would get users turn the heating up a bit or down a bit and would reset automatically when they leave.  This control doesn't exist.  Thinking about what you want building users and the heating operator to be able to do will help you assess the controls that are available.  There are new ones going on the market all the time, and some of them are much more configurable than the traditional ones. Here are some features to think about.

- **Wired vs. wireless.** Wired controls are more reliable because they don't rely on a radio and they never run out of battery.  The wiring is also by far the most expensive and disruptive part of getting new controls.

- **Simplicity of wiring.** If you have trouble engaging a good electrician in your locale, you may struggle to find anyone willing to wire anything apart from what they already know, despite the fact that there are standard wiring patterns shared by all the manufacturers.

- **Limits to what building users can do.** You want your heating volunteer or staff member to be able to change what the heating does, and your building users to be able to make minor variations only for when they are using the building.  Sometimes this is achieved by having the timeswitch in a locked location separate from the end user controls, sometimes through a physical lock or tamper-proof cover that might have a cut out hole for the part of the control the user needs to reach, sometimes through a plastic panel the user won't think to flip down, and sometimes through special keypresses that allow access to more features.  Tamper-proof covers and keypresses that can be found using Google will not always deter the determined user.
