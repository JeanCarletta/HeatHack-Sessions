# Go to setup screen

Now go back to your internet browser.  You can do this with the back arrow button or by pressing the home button and then the browser icon again.
Press enter in the address bar, or if you have already done that, try refreshing the screen.  You will then see the setup screen. 

If you are inactive for more than a minute, the wifi hotspot will shut down to save battery.

:TODO: resolve discussion of whether the user is putting in a location string here or filling in a form to indicate the location (as they might be for the wifi version)
