## Find wifi settings

You now need to find the wifi settings on your device. You may already know how to do this from using the wifi at home or in a cafe or library.

  On an Android phone, you can find the settings by swiping down from the top once to see a set of controls, and then again to reveal a gear icon.  Alternatively, on many phones and tablets, there is a gear icon directly on the home screen when you unlock the device or found by swiping right or left.

  On a Windows laptop, you can type Windows-S (the Windows key and s at the same time) and then "wifi settings" to find them.

  After this step, you will be able to see a list of available wifi networks.
