# Retrieving data if there is no wifi

If your premises don't have wifi, your device saves the data for you to retrieve and email to us for processing.  You should do this every week or two, or else its memory will fill up.  You can use a phone, tablet, or laptop to retrieve the data.  

We show pictures of how to do this on an Android phone, but the process is the same on iPhones, tablets, and laptops, and should work with any fairly modern browser.
