# Hybrid Strategies

Community building operators often have to live with imperfect solutions because there aren't enough community buildings for companies to be interested in marketing heating solutions designed for us.  For instance, many of our buildings have several separate heating systems covering different areas.  They are often too big for a single domestic heat pump, but a commercial pumps are outside our price range.  

<!-- We have a choice between heating controls meant for houses - where people can grudgingly agree how to use them instead of fighting over the settings - or ones meant for factories, schools, and offices where there might be assumptions built in that are more appropriate for 24/7 heating.   -->

This makes "hybrid" solutions useful, either as a long-term strategy or as a way of staging works.  For instance, a heat pump that is too small might still make a big contribution to thermal comfort and be usable on its own for much of the year.  This could greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the building even if the old gas boiler and radiators were used for top up in very cold weather.   The goal might be to then move to infrared panels powered by renewable energy when circumstances permit.
