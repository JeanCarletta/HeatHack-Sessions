# How to Use Our Thermal Monitors

To use one of our thermal monitors, you will need a smartphone, tablet, or laptop you can take to the venue. 

The first thing you need to do is check which version of our monitor you have, version 3 or an earlier version. We began shipping version 3 of the monitor in April 2023.  The v3 monitor comes as a single battery-operated black box, but so did earlier monitors sent out to venues without public wifi service.  If your monitor comes in two pieces, has a wire aerial, or plugs into an electric socket, unless we specifically tell you otherwise, it is a version 1 or version 2 capable of using the internet.

:class: tip

If you are part of our supported Royal Academy of Engineering programme, we will offer to send you a free monitor you can use to collect temperature and relative humidity data for your spaces. 
If you have a version 1 or 2 monitor, and you have difficulty getting readings, get in touch as replacing it may give you better service.
