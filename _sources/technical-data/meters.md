# Energy meter readings

We know that community venues struggle to collect energy meter readings, but without them, consultants can't provide good advice.  Regular meter readings will also help you spot when you start to waste energy accidentally, understand the costs associated with room hires,  and calculate the payback of energy efficiency measures. 

This is why we highly recommend getting **both** gas and electricity smart meters.  

Smart meters send your readings to your utility company every 30 minutes. We expect future energy efficiency consultants to want the full data.   Combining it with heating performance data and historical weather data will let them use "degree days" to understand whether your heating is under good control. 


```{admonition} A good use for "In Home" Displays 
:class: tip

Suppliers of smart electricity meters are required to give you a display that will show your current electricity use.  You can place these anywhere in the building that is within radio range of the meter.

We suggest you see whether it's possible to mount the display at your main exit.  You can use past overnight readings to find out your "base load" - the amount of electricity your building uses when it is empty.  You can then have those who lock up your buildings check the current usage before they leave. If the current usage is higher than expected even allowing for intermittent demand from things like refrigerators, then something has been left on.
