# Smart meters

Smart meters are free, including the cost of installation, unless the installer identifies unsafe conditions on "your" side of the meter.  That's unlikely, but if they do, you want that fixed!  

You can request smart meters from your utility company instead of waiting for them to offer one.   They might refuse you, but they will tell you why.  Usually it's because they know the meter won't be able to communicate with them, your supply is complicated, or your meter is unusual, for instance, in supporting different tariffs for day and night.   You need to have sufficient space around the meter for the installer to make changes, and that can be an issue if you've hidden the meter inside a fancy cabinet.  

 ```{admonition} Do smart meters work?

The early "SMETS1" meters always worked as meters, but they often failed to be "smart" and send regular readings to the utility company.  Usually this was because they couldn't cope with changing suppliers and didn't work in high rise flats, but sometimes they couldn't reach the mobile phone network.  The current "SMETS2" meters can change suppliers and use a better network.  Installers can now test the network signal at the meters before they start work so they can spot problems ahead and tell you your options.

All energy suppliers will make it easy to see from your smart meter how much energy you are currently using by providing you with a display you can place somewhere convenient.  Some suppliers give access to graphs and statistics based on the data, and still others give access to data itself.   If the supplier doesn't, you should be able to get the data using a third party app.
