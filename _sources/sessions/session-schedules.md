# Session schedules

You are free to omit individual items and change the session schedules if you think a different order would work better for you as long as you keep within the spirit of the programme.  We are happy to give you advice about tailoring the programme for your circumstances.  For instance, groups who know they will have to keep their current "wet" heating system for at least a year or two and are worried about energy costs might choose to run session 3 as soon as they have enough winter thermal monitoring data.  Spring starts sometimes go ahead and do session 3, but revisit the material when they have better data later on, even after the main programme.  Some groups compress the programme into longer sessions so they can put the site survey into the first session.
