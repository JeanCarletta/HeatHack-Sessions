**Reduce the hot water temperature**


If you have hot water “on demand” from a combi-boiler or point-of-service hot water heater, you can set it for what feels right at  the taps.  50C is a good starting point.   If you store your hot water, be careful.  Cylinders and tanks need to be regularly raised to 60C to deter Legionella bacteria.  This usually means setting your boiler thermostat at 70C and blending with cold water at the taps.

What to do for this card depends on whether you have a hot water cylinder (storage tank) or something that supplies hot water on demand - either a combi-boiler or a point-of-service hot water heater. 

Hot water cylinders have to be kept above 60C to deter Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaire's disease.  This means setting your boiler thermostat at 70C, or above that if you need it higher for your radiators.

If the hot water isn't being stored, then you can set the hot water for whatever temperature feels right at the taps.  Combi-boilers have a separate dial for this and some manufacturers recommend 50C as a good starting point.
