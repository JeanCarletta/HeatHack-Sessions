**Use smart meters**

Smart meters will help the UK need fewer power stations and let you spot waste and estimate the cost of energy for room hires.  Data from them also enables professionals to give you better advice.  They have a display you can put somewhere convenient to see how much energy you use and spot unexpected changes.    The meters have improved greatly in the last few years and installers can test the meter will be “smart” before installation.
