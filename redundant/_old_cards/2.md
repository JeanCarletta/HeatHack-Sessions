**Keep maintenance records and plan for change**

Decide ahead of time what changes you will make when so you can take advantage of scaffolding that is already up and avoid ripping out new flooring or decoration just to get behind them.   Maintenance records will help you spot problems ahead and could save you scrapping a whole system when one part needs replaced.  Especially, plan for heating changes.  Otherwise you'll end up with an emergency like-for-like replacement.

<!-- :TODO: Heating system maintainers/fixers are often in a hurry to get off site and don't do a great job saying what they had to do, so the same repair can get made over and over again.  Mention having to push back and take an interest in what work was done?? About continuity of who does the servicing?  Or just say nothing?  -->
