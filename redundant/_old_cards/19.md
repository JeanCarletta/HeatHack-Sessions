**Change to point-of-use hot water on demand**

Electric point-of-use hot water heaters only heat the hot water you need “on demand”. That’s a good change if you have an old tank that could fail soon, a condensing boiler you are only running on high to keep the tank safe from Legionella, or if you can’t predict when hot water is needed, so waste a lot of it.  It makes more sense in places without many taps.

Electric point-of-use hot water heaters only heat the hot water you need on demand.  Because they don't store hot water, they can't waste energy when that water cools down.

If you have a hot water storage tank, depending on the circumstances, it may be more efficient to switch to a electric point-of-use water heater instead:

- if it's an old badly insulated tank that could fail soon
- if it's hard for you to predict when you need hot water or you can't set the timings just for when you need it
- if you just need small amounts of hot water
- with hot water from a condensing boiler, if the tank is the only reason to run the boiler on a high temperature 
- if it's a long way between the tank and the tap(s) and there aren't many of them

You will need to consider running costs as well in making your decision, since electricity is currently more expensive than gas.   They typically draw 3-7 kW when they are in use.
