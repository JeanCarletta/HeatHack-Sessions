**Insulate hot pipes and tanks**

You don’t want to lose heat to the wrong spaces.  Any hot pipes that are outside the rooms you want to heat should be insulated, including in the boiler room.  A good installer will insulate all the tricky bits of pipework, not just the straight lengths. It’s also important to insulate hot water cylinders.  Modern cylinders should already have enough hardened foam insulation but older ones might need more.  The modern standard is 80mm.  You can “top up” with a cylinder jacket of the right size.

Any pipes in the space you're trying to heat could be useful - in older systems, the heat they give off will be part of the design.  You only need to insulate them if they're making a room too warm.

Any pipes that are in other spaces, including the boiler, should be insulated.  A good installer will insulate all the tricky bits, not just the straight lengths of pipe.
