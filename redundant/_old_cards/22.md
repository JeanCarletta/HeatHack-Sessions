**Put countdown timers on big electrics**

Electric heating, urns and sound equipment often get left on, even overnight. You can buy special “countdown timers" or  “time delay push” switches that will only supply electricity to a device for a set amount of time before the user will need to use the switch again.   There are also timers available, although they're only useful if the electrics should be on for a very regular schedule.   Alternatively, you could put in hotel-style keycards that control whether electricity is supplied to some circuits.

It is extremely common in community buildings to find electric heating and urns left on, sometimes even overnight.  You can buy special "countdown timer" or "time delay push" switches that will only supply electricity to a device for a set amount of time before the user will need to use the switch again.

Sometimes you set the amount of time for the switch and sometimes the switch gives the user several choices - for instance, power for 1, 2, or 3 hours.
