# Room thermostats and thermostatic radiator valves

Many community buildings use room thermostats and thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) to control their space heating temperatures.

On both room thermostats and TRVs, the dial represents the room temperature, although on a TRV that's so rough that it's just on a scale from low to high. Unfortunately, almost every believes that if you turn the dial up, the room will warm up faster.  It won't, but it will make the room overheat and cost more money. 

On a TRV, when the radiator reaches the temperature, the valve keeps any more hot water from reaching the radiator.  This only affects the one radiator, although with smart TRVs they can be programmed so that altering one changes every TRV in the room.  

Room thermostats are usually set up so that - when the room is warm, the boiler shuts off.  That means that if a group in the room with the room thermostat turns it down, everyone else could end up cold.  You can check this by having one person turn the room thermostat all the way down while another watches the boiler.

Room thermostats and TRVs create some issues in community buildings because they usually change the set room temperature permanently.  Since we have different groups coming in for different activities, they all want different settings.  In a typical building that's slow to respond to setting changes and where groups are only in for an hour or two, that means every group gets the settings chosen by the previous group.  Groups that are cold turn the dials all the way up and then forget them when they leave, making the next group turn them all the way down.  The next time, the cold group brings in portable space heaters.

Some organisations try to solve the problem by putting tamper proof covers over the controls.  This doesn't work as well because it doesn't solve the core problem that different groups demand different temperatures.  Users will always find a way to make themselves comfortable, but these ways waste energy and often create safety hazards.  

Thankfully, there are several possible solutions.  They vary in price.

- **Limiting pins**.  It's possible to get small pins for many room thermostats and TRVs that can be used to limit their range.  They keep users from turning them all the way up and all the way down.  This is cheap but doesn't solve the problem completely.  


- **Controls with time limits.** Some controls are designed so that any changes users can make will apply just for a set time, like one hour or until the next time you've set in the heating schedule.  With room thermostats, this is more likely if you choose controls that combine the heating programmer and room thermostat into one box on the wall, a "programmable thermostat".  For TRVs, the only way to get the feature is to move to "smart" models.

- **Manual operation.**  Some staffed buildings choose to make finding out the user preferences and setting the heat between room hires part of a job.
