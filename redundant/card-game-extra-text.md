Our groups are highly varied:

-  there are modern buildings and traditional ones (many listed or with special features like stained glass windows)
- they use their spaces constantly, or once a week
- the group members are all involved in running the organisation, or they are mostly people from the local neighbourhood
- they use different kinds of heating and different heating strategies
- some are up for big retrofits; some are mostly looking for things they can do immediately

The cards reflect this range.   Not all actions will be appropriate for all groups.  This makes it hard to give good tailored explanations for them.  Groups need to keep this in mind as they think about the cards, and take professional advice, especially when it comes to older buildings, to avoid damaging their buildings through inappropriate treatment.  The role of the engineer in the group isn't to provide this advice.  Engineers are used to thinking about project management, budgets, and how to choose among different options.  The engineer is here to try to help guide the process and to be the "game master" who has at hand the explanations of what the cards mean.
