# Future changes to the game

We intend the following changes in next version of the game for the end of September 2023:

- Move the destratification fan card to "actions we've excluded".  Science-minded people can find the idea very attractive and we think it's always likely to be a distraction.

- Add a card for "Have a five-year maintenance plan" that separates out urgent maintenance for this year, mid priority, and longer term actions.  In the church community, conservation architects produce 'quinquennial reports' that provide this plan, but other kinds of organisations might not have them.  Following a plan will minimise expensive damage to the building, make it possible to improve the building instead of making emergency like-for-like replacements, and keep you from wasting money putting scaffolding in the same area twice.  Lots of other cards, like "Keep the building dry", are related so we have to think about whether we need to change those cards if we add this.

- mark steps on the cards that reinforce the standard priorities for action from the Centre for Sustainable Enery: reduce energy demand, address heat loss, decarbonise, and generate energy.  The colours on the cards will match the steps.  

- print an 100 word summary of the action on the back of the cards.

The last two are changes we have already made in the version of the card game for the Scottish Episcopal Church, so you can get a sense of them here.
