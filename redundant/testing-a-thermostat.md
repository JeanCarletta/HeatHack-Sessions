# Testing a thermostat

Thermostatic radiator valves just cut the flow of hot water through a radiator, controlling the heating for the room they are in.  Thermostats on the wall in a community venue might do that, but they very often turn the boiler on and off or control the flow of water for every radiator on the same circuit  instead. This is a very common arrangement in housing because it's an easy way to satisfy the energy efficiency requirements in the building regulations.  It can be very confusing in community venues, because the behaviour of one group can affect the comfort of an entirely different group in another room.  For this reason, you want to know what your thermostat does.  

Non-working thermostats are common:

- wired thermostats might be from a previous system - some venues purposely leave a decoy stat on the wall to give users something to try, in others, the workers were untidy
- wireless thermostats could have flat batteries, be out of radio reach of the boiler, or be suffering from radio interference

It's possible to test whether a thermostat is technically working.  A very basic test for a room thermostat is to station someone else at the boiler and see if you can get the boiler to turn on and off by using the dial.  Testing a thermostatic radiator valve is similar and sometimes can be judged by the noise rather than waiting to see if the radiator heats or cools.

A thermostat could be working but still ineffective.  This is usually because it is badly placed - for instance, attached to a very cold stone wall that overwhelms its sense of the air temperature, in a corner with low airflow, above a heat source, or in the sun.  This is especially likely for wired thermostats, since electricians prefer convenient locations.

If you can see clear evidence from the data plots that a thermostat is working, there's no reason to test basic operation, but you might still need to test whether it controls the boiler or just a motorised valve governing one room.
