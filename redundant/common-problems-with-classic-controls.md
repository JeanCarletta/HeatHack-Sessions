# Typical control problems in our buildings

The kinds of controls that work in houses often don't work well in community buildings.  This is because occupants often aren't even aware who else might be using the building.  They certainly aren't in a position to negotiate about the settings.  They also won't ever know if what they do with a control has long-lasting effects.  This causes some classic difficulties.

**Thermostat wars.** Almost all building users think that if you turn a thermostat up all the way, a space will heat faster.  The maximum value on a room thermostat or TRV is usually around 26C.  Many people who hire rooms automatically turn the thermostat all the way up as soon as they enter, but once a class or group has started, they're too engaged to turn it down.  Similarly, on the rarer occasion when they feel too hot, if they don't just open the windows they will turn the thermostat all the way down.  The next group will inevitably be cold.  TRVs are fairly fragile and often end up broken by being wrenched.  If there are multiple TRVs in the room, it's a big burden on groups or community volunteers to reset them between every room hire.

**Turning down the heating for everyone.** Whichever group has the room with the room thermostat can cause everyone else to be cold.  They won't know why.

**Leaving the heating on (or off).**  Many timeswitches have an "override" button that will make the system stay on or off, either for, say, an hour, or until the next heating change.  This can be useful in some buildings.  Unfortunately, usually if you press the same button for longer than usual or press it twice, the heating will stay on (or off) until someone else intervenes manually.  This often happens by accident.  If the override turns the heating on, it's possible for it to stay on for quite some time before anyone notices.  Even if staff would notice first thing in the morning, it can waste a lot of energy if the override is from the last group of the day.
