# Radiant heating

Infrared heating doesn't attempt to warm the air in a space - it just makes people comfortable by warming them and the space's surfaces.  It relies on radiant heat to do this, the same principle that makes you feel warm in the sun.    Of course, if you leave it on long enough, it will warm the air as well as a side effect.   There are buildings in frequent use that use radiant heating as their only heating source.

Infrared heating can be used as the sole form of heating or as a "top-up".  For instance, if you want to switch to an air source heat pump but it won't cover all your heating needs, you might use the pump to provide a constant level of background heating, and just add infrared in the depths of winter or for groups that need more heating than usual.  Similarly, you could use infrared heating to reduce your reliance on an existing gas boiler.  You could also use it for rooms that need warmth when the rest of the space is empty.

Infrared heaters are usually mounted at high level for safety and to give them wide angle coverage of the space.  A major advantage is that they only need to be on when people are in, although the warmth doesn't last, unlike for convective heating.  The running costs should be lower than for convective electric heating and they are low maintenance, unlike gas boilers.

You need to get the right kind of infrared heating for your needs.  It comes in a range of wavelengths.  Short-wave heaters get very, very hot - up to 1500 degrees C - and are intended for outdoor spaces that need that intensity of heat to have any effect.  Medium-wave heaters are cool enough to be comfortable for longer use and are the usual choice for large, draughty spaces.  Short-wave are cooler still and might be, for instance, mounted on the ceiling of a relatively small space.  The longer the wave length, the more penetrating the heat is.  

You'll need professional help to assess what type is best for your application and calculate heating requirements for the space so you don't install more heating than you need - users aren't good at turning things off or down. 

Radiant panels may be news to many of us, but they aren’t a new technology at all – they’ve been used in the more sensitive parts of hospitals for years because they don’t collect and redistribute dust like radiators do. In hospitals they are often mounted on the ceiling to keep them away from people and free up the wall space. That means there are also radiant panel manufacturers who have been around for years and they are much more likely to provide good equipment than the many Chinese factories now starting to make and sell them. Many of the long-standing British manufacturers will design a system for you using their equipment. We wouldn’t recommend asking an installer to do a design, but you can trust the manufacturers to get this right and if an independent consultant is really more used to gas boilers, this is the approach they’ll use themselves.

We've been told by a consultant that Frenger, Solray, and Consort Claudgen are all reputable manufacturers, but there are probably others. Herschel has lots of options including chandeliers that look to become popular in heritage buildings like churches. The Consort Claudgen “Twinzone” is unusual in being able to deliver narrow beam or wide beam heating, depending on how it is assembled. Any decent manufacturer will give you full technical specifications for what they sell. If, like many of the Chinese models, they don’t even tell you the beam angle of the panel and the distance it should be mounted from people to make them warm, you’ll want to steer well clear.

The manufacturers won’t install the panels for you. With gas boilers, the installer’s skills make a real difference to performance, efficiency, and longevity. With radiant panels, they don’t. Any competent electrical contractor should be able to install the equipment to a specified design.

There are a few gotchas to be aware of for panels. Be careful about having the right power supply. Some panels require a three phase supply. If you put enough panels in a building, you might find you need a beefier power supply to run them. For instance, if you were to put in 12 3.6 kW radiant panels, that takes enough current to be an issue for some of our buildings. In heritage buildings, you’ll also want to think about how the panels should be mounted.
