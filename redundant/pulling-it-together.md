## Pulling it all together

Scientists try to come up with numbers that reflect how comfortable people will be in terms of what percentage of people will be dissatisfied under which conditions.  That has led to building standards that work well for some buildings.  

Community buildings almost always fall outside the range that the standards consider comfortable - and yet, people still use these spaces.  The standards don't tell the whole story, especially for buildings made of traditional materials or with natural ventilation, because they are based on research in modern buildings and in controlled environments.  It's worth being aware of this in case you encounter any professionals who are more accustomed to modern buildings and controlled environments, as they make make design assumptions that are inappropriate for your circumstances.

:class: tip 

The original science behind thermal comfort assessment standards is based on putting six people at a time in a diving bell modified to control temperature, RH, and draughts, and asking them how they feel.
