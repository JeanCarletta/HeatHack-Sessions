# Main causes of damp

- **Water ingress.**  If there's just one thing that's important to keep the building in good shape, it's making sure the roof is sound and that the rainwater clearance systems - gutters (called "rhones" in Scotland) and downpipes must be in good working order and kept clear.  With the increased rainfall that comes with climate change, some buildings are already finding that they have to increase the capacity of their rainwater clearance to avoid wetting the walls of their building.

- **Blocked vents.**  People and sometimes other activities release moisture into the building.  If the building's vents are blocked, then it's hard for that moisture to escape.  Some building operators deliberately block vents to avoid heat escaping.  In many others, vents in the walls on the outside of the building to bring in fresh air get clogged with leaves and other debris.  Many buildings include ventilation features that are meant to be operated manually, but it's hard to get their use right in shared spaces.

In traditional buildings, also:

- **Non-breatheable finishes.** Require lime plaster and breatheable paints - and often the issue with mysterious damp problems.

- **Inappropriate or incorrectly installed insulation.** Again, breatheability of the materials but also the design (not allowing the required airflow to preserve the roof, for instance).

- **Warm moist air from outside.** It's tempting on a nice spring day to open the building up and let the air warm the building, but in a massive stone building, the surfaces can be cold enough to cause condensation to run down the walls inside the building.
