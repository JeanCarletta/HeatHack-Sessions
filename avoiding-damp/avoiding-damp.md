# Avoiding damp

Some community groups with buildings that are only lightly used turn on the heating for a little while every day because they're worried about a building being damp or because they're trying to dry out a building that is already damp.  This isn't the best way to approach the problem.  To understand
why not, we need to consider why buildings get damp in the first place.
