# Which people should we engage?

The answer to this question depends on your circumstances.  However, we encourage all organisations to think broadly about who has a stake in their buildings.  Your stakeholders aren't just the people you talk to frequently. The more outward-looking you are, the more likely you are to learn things from the community engagement process that will improve what you do.

Think about:

- Your building's users.
- Under-served local groups and organisations that understand unmet local needs.  This might include the local Health and Social Care Partnership and community council.  They are likely to be involved in wider community or neighbourhood planning.
- Groups providing similar services to the community nearby.
- Neighbours.  They might have helpful ideas, want to collaborate, or be impacted in a way that could lead them to raise objections later.
